<p class="pc1 mid">CANADA AND LOUISIANA.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY ANDREW McFARLAND DAVIS,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>American Antiquarian Society</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE story of the French occupation in America is not that of a people
slowly moulding itself into a nation. In France there was no state
but the king; in Canada there could be none but the governor. Events
cluster around the lives of individuals. According to the discretion of the
leaders the prospects of the colony rise and fall. Stories of the machinations
of priests at Quebec and at Montreal, of their heroic sufferings at
the hands of the Hurons and the Iroquois, and of individual deeds of valor
performed by soldiers, fill the pages of the record. The prosperity of the
colony rested upon the fate of a single industry,&mdash;the trade in peltries. In
pursuit of this, the hardy trader braved the danger from lurking savage,
shot the boiling rapids of the river in his light bark canoe, ventured upon
the broad bosom of the treacherous lake, and patiently endured sufferings
from cold in winter and from the myriad forms of insect life which infest
the forests in summer. To him the hazard of the adventure was as attractive
as the promised reward. The sturdy agriculturist planted his seed each
year in dread lest the fierce war-cry of the Iroquois should sound in his
ear, and the sharp, sudden attack drive him from his work. He reaped his
harvest with urgent haste, ever expectant of interruption from the same
source, always doubtful as to the result until the crop was fairly housed.
The brief season of the Canadian summer, the weary winter, the hazards of
the crop, the feudal tenure of the soil,&mdash;all conspired to make the life of
the farmer full of hardship and barren of promise. The sons of the early
settlers drifted to the woods as independent hunters and traders. The
parent State across the water, which undertook to say who might trade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
where and how the traffic should be carried on, looked upon this way of
living as piratical. To suppress the crime, edicts were promulgated from
Versailles and threats were thundered from Quebec. Still, the temptation
to engage in what Parkman calls the “hardy, adventurous, lawless, fascinating
fur-trade” was much greater than to enter upon the dull monotony
of ploughing, sowing, and reaping. The Iroquois, alike the enemies of
farmer and of trader, bestowed their malice impartially upon the two
callings, so that the risk was fairly divided. It was not surprising that the
life of the fur-trader “proved more attractive, absorbed the enterprise of
the colony, and drained the life-sap from other branches of commerce.”
It was inevitable, with the young men wandering off to the woods, and with
the farmers habitually harassed during both seed-time and harvest, that the
colony should at times be unable to produce even grain enough for its own
use, and that there should occasionally be actual suffering from lack of food.
It often happened that the services of all the strong men were required to
bear arms in the field, and that there remained upon the farms only old
men, women, and children to reap the harvest. Under such circumstances
want was sure to follow during the winter months. Such was the condition
of affairs in 1700. The grim figure of Frontenac had passed finally from
the stage of Canadian politics. On his return, in 1689, he had found the
name of Frenchman a mockery and a taunt.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Iroquois sounded their
threats under the very walls of the French forts. When, in 1698, the old
warrior died, he was again their “Onontio,” and they were his children.
The account of what he had done during those years was the history of
Canada for the time. His vigorous measures had restored the self-respect
of his countrymen, and had inspired with wholesome fear the wily savages
who threatened the natural path of his fur-trade. The tax upon the people,
however, had been frightful. A French population of less than twelve
thousand had been called upon to defend a frontier of hundreds of miles
against the attacks of a jealous and warlike confederacy of Indians, who, in
addition to their own sagacious views upon the policy of maintaining these
wars, were inspired thereto by the great rival of France behind them.</p>

<p>To the friendship which circumstances cemented between the English
and the Iroquois, the alliance between the French and the other tribes was
no fair offset. From the day when Champlain joined the Algonquins and
aided them to defeat their enemies near the site of Ticonderoga, the
hostility of the great Confederacy had borne an important part in the
history of Canada. Apart from this traditional enmity, the interests of
the Confederacy rested with the English, and not with the French. If the
Iroquois permitted the Indians of the Northwest to negotiate with the
French, and interposed no obstacle to the transportation of peltries from
the upper lakes to Montreal and Quebec, they would forfeit all the commercial
benefits which belonged to their geographical position. Thus their
natural tendency was to join with the English. The value of neutrality was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
plain to their leaders; nevertheless, much of the time they were the willing
agents of the English in keeping alive the chronic border war.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Indian tribes understood that the conditions of trade were
better with the English than with the French; but the personal influence
of the French with their allies was powerful enough partially to overcome
this advantage of their rivals. This influence was exercised not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
through missionaries,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but was also felt through the national characteristics
of the French themselves, which were strongly in harmony with the spirit
of forest life. The Canadian bushrangers appropriated the ways and the
customs of the natives. They were often adopted into the tribes, and when
this was done, their advice in council was listened to with respect. They
married freely into the Indian nations with whom they were thrown; and
the offspring of these marriages, scattered through the forests of the Northwest,
were conspicuous among hunters and traders for their skill and
courage. “It has been supposed for a long while,” says one of the officers
of the colony, “that to civilize the savages it was necessary to bring them
in contact with the French. We have every reason to recognize the fact
that we were mistaken. Those who have come in contact with us have
not become French, while the French who frequent the wilds have become
savages.” Prisoners held by the Indians often concealed themselves rather
than return to civilized life, when their surrender was provided for by a
treaty of peace.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Powerful as these influences had proved with the allies of the French,
no person realized more keenly than M. de Callières, the successor of
Frontenac, how incompetent they were to
overcome the natural drift of the Iroquois
to the English. He it was who had urged
at Versailles the policy of carrying the war
into the province of New York as the only
means of ridding Canada of the periodic
invasions of the Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He had joined with Frontenac in urging upon
the astute monarch who had tried the experiment of using Iroquois as
galley-slaves, the impolicy of abandoning the posts at Michilimakinac and
at St. Joseph. His appointment was recognized as suitable, not only by
the colonists, but also by Charlevoix, who tells us that “from the beginning
he had acquired great influence over the savages, who recognized in him
a man exact in the performance of his word, and who insisted that others
should adhere to promises given to him.” He saw accomplished what
Frontenac had labored for,&mdash;a peace with the Iroquois in which the allied
tribes were included. The Hurons, the Ottawas, the Abenakis, and the
converted Iroquois having accepted the terms of the peace, the Governor-General,
the Intendant, the Governor of Montreal, and the ecclesiastical
authorities signed a provisional treaty on the 8th of September, 1700. In
1703, while the Governor still commanded the confidence of his countrymen,
his career was cut short by death.</p>

<p>The reins of government now fell into the hands of Philippe de Vaudreuil,
who retained the position of governor until his death. During the
entire period of his administration Canada was free from the horrors of
Indian invasion. By his adroit management,
with the aid of Canadians adopted by
the tribes, and of missionaries, the Iroquois
were held in check. The scene in which
startled villagers were roused from their
midnight slumber by the fierce war-whoop,
the report of the musket, and the light of burning dwellings, was transferred
from the Valley of the St. Lawrence to New England. Upon Vaudreuil must
rest the responsibility for the attacks upon Deerfield in 1704 and Haverhill
in 1708, and for the horrors of the Abenakis war. The pious Canadians,
fortified by a brief preliminary invocation of Divine aid, rushed upon the
little settlements and perpetrated cruelties of the same class with those
which characterized the brutal attacks of the Iroquois upon the villages in
Canada. The cruel policy of maintaining the alliance with the Abenakis,
and at the same time securing quiet in Canada by encouraging raids upon the
defenceless towns of New England, not only left a stain upon the reputation
of Vaudreuil, but it also hastened the end of French power in America by
convincing the growing, prosperous, and powerful colonies known as New
England that the only path to permanent peace lay through the downfall
of French rule in Canada.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Aroused to action by Canadian raids, the New England colonies increased
their contributions to the military expeditions by way of Lake
Champlain and the St. Lawrence, which had become and remained, until
Wolfe’s success obviated their necessity, the recognized method of attack
on Canada. During Vaudreuil’s time these expeditions were singularly
unfortunate. Some extraneous incident protected Quebec each year.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
It is not strange that such disasters to the English were looked upon by
the pious French as a special manifestation of the interest taken in Canada
by the Deity. Thanks were given in all parts of the colony to God, who
had thus directly saved the province, and special fêtes were celebrated in
honor of Notre Dame des Victoires.</p>

<p>The total population of Canada at this time was not far from eighteen
thousand. The English colonies counted over four hundred thousand
inhabitants. The French Governor, in a despatch to M. de Pontchartrain,
called attention, in 1714, to the great disproportion of strength between the
French and English settlements, and added that there could be little doubt
that on the occasion of the first rupture the English would make a powerful
effort to get possession of Canada. The English colonies were in themselves
strong enough easily to have overthrown the French in America.
In addition, they were supported by the Home Government; while Louis
XIV., defeated, humiliated, baffled at every turn, was compelled supinely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to witness these extraordinary efforts to wrest from him the colonies in
which he had taken such personal interest. Well might the devout Canadian
offer up thanks for his deliverance from the defeat which had seemed
inevitable! Well might he ascribe it to an interposition of Divine Providence
in his behalf! Under the circumstances we need not be surprised
that a learned prelate should chronicle the fact that the Baron de Longueuil,
before leaving Montreal in command of a detachment of troops,
“received from M. de Belmont, <i>grand vicaire</i>, a flag around which that
celebrated recluse, Mlle. Le Ber, had embroidered a prayer to the Holy
Virgin,” nor that it should have been noticed that on the very day on
which was finished “a nine days’ devotion to Notre Dame de Pitié,” the
news of the wreck of Sir Hovenden Walker’s fleet reached Quebec.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Such
coincidences appeal to the imagination. Their record, amid the dry facts
of history, shows the value which was attached to what Parkman impatiently
terms this “incessant supernaturalism.” To us, the skilful diplomacy of
Vaudreuil, the intelligent influence of Joncaire (the adopted brother of the
Senecas), the powerful aid of the missionaries, the stupid obstinacy of Sir
Hovenden Walker, and certain coincidences of military movements in
Europe at periods critical for Canada, explain much more satisfactorily
the escape of Canada from subjection to the English during the period
of the wars of the Spanish Succession.</p>

<p>Although Vaudreuil could influence the Iroquois to remain at peace,
he could not prevent an outbreak of the Outagamis at Detroit. This,
however, was easily suppressed. The nominal control of the trade of the
Northwest remained with the French; but the value of this control was
much reduced by the amount of actual traffic which drifted to Albany and
New York, drawn thither by the superior commercial inducements offered
by the English.</p>

<p>The treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, established the cession of Acadia to the
English by its “ancient limits.” When the French saw that the English pretension
to claim by these words all the territory between the St. Lawrence
River and the ocean, was sure to cut them off by water from their colony
at Quebec, in case of another war, they on their part confined such “ancient
limits” to the peninsula now called Nova Scotia. France, to strengthen the
means of maintaining her interpretation, founded the fortress and naval
station of Louisbourg.</p>

<p>About the same time the French also determined to strengthen the
fortifications of Quebec and Montreal; and in 1721 Joncaire established
a post among the Senecas at Niagara.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In 1725 Vaudreuil died. Ferland curtly says that the Governor’s wife
was the man of the family; but so far as the record shows, the preservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of Canada to France during the earlier part of his administration was
largely due to his vigilance and discretion. Great judgment and skill were
shown in dealing with the Indians. A letter of remonstrance from Peter
Schuyler bears witness that contemporary judgment condemned his policy
in raiding upon the New England colonies; but in forming our estimate of
his character we must remember that the French believed that similar atrocities,
committed by the Iroquois in the Valley of the St. Lawrence, were
instigated by the English.</p>

<p>The administration<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of M. de Beauharnois, his successor, who arrived
in the colony in 1726, was not conspicuous. He appears to have been
personally popular, and to have appreciated fairly the needs of Canada.
The Iroquois were no longer hostile. The days of the martyrdom of the
Brebeufs and the Lallemands were over.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In the Far West a company of
traders founded a settlement at the foot of Lake Pepin, which they called
Fort Beauharnois. As the trade with the Valley of the Mississippi developed,
routes of travel began to be defined. Three of these were especially
used,&mdash;one by way of Lake Erie, the Maumee, and the Wabash, and
then down the Ohio; another by way of Lake Michigan, the Chicago
River, a portage to the Illinois, and down that river; a third by way of
Green Bay, Fox River, and the Wisconsin,&mdash;all three being independent
of La Salle’s route from the foot of Lake Michigan to the Kankakee and
Illinois rivers.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> By special orders from France, Joncaire’s post at Niagara
had been regularly fortified. The importance of this movement had been
fully appreciated by the English. As an offset to that post, a trading
establishment had been opened at Oswego; and now that a fort was built
at Niagara, Oswego was garrisoned. The French in turn constructed a fort
at Crown Point, which threatened Oswego, New York, and New England.</p>

<p>The prolonged peace permitted considerable progress in the development
of the agricultural resources of the country. Commerce was extended
as much as the absurd system of farming out the posts, and the trading
privileges retained by the governors, would permit. Postal arrangements
were established between Montreal and Quebec in 1721. The population
at that time was estimated at twenty-five thousand. Notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
evident difficulty experienced in taking care of what country the French
then nominally possessed, M. Varenne de Vérendrye in 1731 fitted out
an expedition to seek for the “Sea of the West,”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and actually penetrated
to Lake Winnipeg.</p>

<p>The foundations of society were violently disturbed during this administration
by a quarrel which began in a contest over the right to bury a dead
bishop. Governor, Intendant, council, and clergy took part. “Happily,”
says a writer to whom both Church and State were dear, “M. de Beauharnois
did not wish to take violent measures to make the Intendant obey him,
otherwise we might have seen repeated the scandalous scenes of the evil
days of Frontenac.”</p>

<p>After the fall of Louisbourg, in 1745, Beauharnois was recalled, and
Admiral de la Jonquière
was commissioned as his
successor; but he did not
then succeed in reaching
his post. It is told in a
later chapter how D’Anville’s
fleet, on which he
was embarked, was scattered in 1746; and when he again sailed, the next
year, with other ships, an English fleet captured him and bore him to
London.</p>

<p>In consequence of this, Comte de la Galissonière was appointed Governor
of Canada in 1747. His term of office was brief; but he made his
mark as one of the most intelligent
of those who had been called upon to
administer the affairs of this government.
He proceeded at once to fortify
the scattered posts from Lake
Superior to Lake Ontario. He forwarded to France a scheme for colonizing
the Valley of the Ohio; and in order to protect the claims of France
to this vast region, he sent out an expedition,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> with instructions to bury at
certain stated points leaden plates upon which were cut an assertion of these
claims. These instructions were fully carried out, and depositions establishing
the facts were executed and transmitted to France. He notified
the Governor of Pennsylvania of the steps which had been taken, and
requested him to prevent his people from trading beyond the Alleghanies,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as orders had been given to seize any English merchants found trading
there. An endeavor was made to establish at Bay Verte a settlement which
should offset the growing importance of Halifax, founded by the English.
The minister warmly supported La Galissonière in this, and made him a
liberal money allowance in aid of the plan. While busily engaged upon
this scheme, he was recalled. Before leaving, he prepared for his successor
a statement of the condition of the colony and its needs.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>By the terms of the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, France in 1748 acquired
possession of Louisbourg. La Jonquière, who was at the same time liberated,
and who in 1749 assumed the government under his original appointment,
did not agree with the Acadian policy of his predecessor. He feared
the consequences of an armed collision with the English in Nova Scotia,
which this course was likely to precipitate. This caution on his part
brought down upon him a reprimand from Louis XV. and positive orders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
carry out La Galissonière’s programme. In pursuance of these instructions,
the neck of the peninsula, which according to the French claim formed
the boundary of Acadia, was fortified. The conservatism of the English
officer prevented a conflict. In 1750, avoiding the territory in dispute,
the English fortified upon ground admitted to be within their own lines,
and watched events. On the approach of the English, the unfortunate
inhabitants of Beaubassin abandoned their homes and sought protection
under the French flag.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the claims to the Valley of the Ohio put forth by the
French, the English Government in 1750 granted to a company six hundred
thousand acres of land in that region; and English colonial governors continued
to issue permits to trade in the disputed territory. Following the
instructions of the Court, as suggested by La Galissonière, English traders
were arrested, and sent to France as prisoners. The English, by way of
reprisal, seized French traders found in the same region.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle had provided for a commission to adjust the boundaries between
the French and the English possessions. By the terms of the treaty,
affairs were to remain unchanged until the commission could determine
the boundaries between the colonies. Events did not stand still during
the deliberations of the commission; and the doubt whether every act
along the border was a violation of the treaty hung over the heads of the
colonists like the dispute as to the boundaries of Acadia, which was a
constant threat of war. The situation all along the Acadian frontier and
in the Valley of the Ohio was now full of peril. To add to the difficulty of
the crisis in Canada, the flagrant corruption of the Intendant Bigot, with
whom the Governor was in close communication, created distrust and
dissatisfaction. Charges of nepotism and corruption were made against La
Jonquière. The proud old man demanded his recall; but before he could
appear at Court to answer the charges, chagrin and mortification caused
his wounds to open, and he died on the 17th of May, 1752. Thereupon
the government fell to the Baron de Longueuil till a new governor could
arrive.</p>

<p>Bigot, whose name, according to Garneau, will hereafter be associated
with all the misfortunes of France upon this continent, was Intendant at
Louisbourg at the time of its fall. Dissatisfaction with him on the part of
the soldiers at not receiving their pay was alleged as an explanation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
their mutinous behavior. He was afterward attached to the unfortunate
fleet which was sent out to recapture the place. Later his baneful influence
shortened the days and tarnished the reputation of La Jonquière.</p>

<p>In July, 1752, the Marquis Duquesne de Menneville assumed charge
of the government, under instructions to pursue the policy suggested by
La Galissonière. He immediately held a review of the troops and militia.
At that time the number of inhabitants capable of bearing arms was about
thirteen thousand. There existed a line of military posts from the St.
Lawrence to the Mississippi, composed of Quebec, Montreal, Ogdensburg,
Kingston, Toronto, Detroit, the Miami River, St. Joseph, Chicago, and Fort
Chartres. The same year that Duquesne was installed, he took preliminary
steps toward forwarding troops to occupy the Valley of the Ohio, and in
1753 these steps were followed by the actual occupation in force of that
region. Another line of military posts was erected, with the intention of
preventing the English from trading in that valley and of asserting the
right of the French to the possession of the tributaries of the Mississippi.
This line began at Niagara, and ultimately comprehended Erie, French
Creek,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Venango, and Fort Duquesne. All these posts were armed, provisioned,
and garrisoned.</p>

<p>All French writers agree in calling the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle a mere
truce. If the sessions of the commissioners appointed to determine the
boundaries upon the <i>ante-bellum</i> basis had resulted in aught else than
bulky volumes,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> their decision would have been practically forestalled by
the French in thus taking possession of all the territory in dispute. To this,
however, France was impelled by the necessities of the situation. Unless
she could assume and maintain this position, the rapidly increasing population
of the English colonies threatened to overflow into the Valley of the
Ohio; and the danger was also imminent that the French might be dispossessed
from the southern tributaries of the St. Lawrence. Once in
possession, English occupation would be permanent. The aggressive spirit
of La Galissonière had led him to recommend these active military operations,
which, while they tended to provoke collision, could hardly fail to
check the movement of colonization which threatened the region in dispute.
On the Acadian peninsula the troops had come face to face without bloodshed.
The firmness of the French commander in asserting his right to
occupy the territory in question, the prudence of the English officer,
the support given to the French cause by the patriotic Acadians, the
military weakness of the English in Nova Scotia,&mdash;all conspired to cause
the English to submit to the offensive bearing of the French, and to avoid
in that locality the impending collision. It was, however, a mere postponement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in time and transfer of scene. The gauntlet thrown down at
the mouth of the St. Lawrence was to be taken up at the headwaters of
the Ohio.</p>

<p>The story of the interference of Lieutenant-Governor Dinwiddie; of
George Washington’s lonely journey in 1753 across the mountains with
Dinwiddie’s letter; of the perilous tramp back in midwinter with Saint-Pierre’s
reply; of the return next season with a body of troops; of the collision
with the detachment of the French under Jumonville; of the little fort
which Washington erected, and called Fort Necessity, where he was besieged
and compelled to capitulate; of the unfortunate articles of capitulation
which he then signed,&mdash;the story of all these events is familiar to readers
of our colonial history; but it is equally a portion of the history of
Canada.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The act of Dinwiddie in precipitating a collision between the
armed forces of the colonies and those of France was the first step in the
war which was to result in driving the French from the North American
continent. The first actual bloodshed was when the men under Washington
met what was claimed by the French to be a mere armed escort accompanying
Jumonville to an interview with the English. He who was to act
so important a part in the war of the American Revolution was, by some
strange fatality, the one who was in command in this backwoods skirmish.
In itself the event was insignificant; but the blow once struck, the question
how the war was to be carried on had to be met. The relations of the colonies
to the mother country, and the possibility of a confederation for the
purpose of consolidating the military power and adjusting the expenses,
were necessarily subjects of thought and discussion which tended toward
co-operative movements dangerous to the parent State. Thus in its after-consequences
that collision was fraught with importance. Bancroft says
it “kindled the first great war of revolution.”</p>

<p>The collision which had taken place could not have been much longer
postponed. The English colonies had grown much more rapidly than the
French. They were more prosperous. There was a spirit of enterprise
among them which was difficult to crush. They could not tamely see
themselves hemmed in upon the Atlantic coast and cut off from access to
the interior of the continent by a colony whose inhabitants did not count
a tenth part of their own numbers, and with whom hostility seemed an
hereditary necessity. It mattered not whether the rights of discovery and
prior occupation, asserted by the French, constituted, according to the law
of nations, a title more or less sound than that which the English claimed
through Indian tribes whom the French had by treaty recognized as
British subjects. The title held by the strongest side would be better than
the title based upon international law. Events had already anticipated
politics. The importance of the Ohio Valley to the English colonies as
an outlet to their growing population had been forced upon their attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
To the French, who were just becoming accustomed to its use as a highway
for communication between Canada and Louisiana, the growth of the
latter colony was a daily instruction as to its value.</p>

<p class="p2">The Louisiana which thus helped to bring the French face to face with
their great rivals was described by Charlevoix as “the name which M. de La
Salle gave to that portion of the country watered by the Mississippi which
lies below the River Illinois.” This definition limits Louisiana to the Valley
of the Mississippi; but the French cartographers of the middle of the
eighteenth century put no boundary to the pretensions of their country
in the vague regions of the West, concerning which tradition, story, and
fable were the only sources of information for their charts. The claims of
France to this indefinite territory were, however, considered of sufficient
importance to be noticed in the document on the Northwestern Boundary
question which forms the basis of Greenhow’s <i>History of Oregon and California</i>.
The French were not disturbed by the pretensions of Spain to a
large part of the same territory, although based upon the discovery of the
Mississippi by De Soto and the actual occupation of Florida. Neither were
the charters of those English colonies, which granted territory from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, regarded as constituting valid claims to this region.
France had not deliberately set out to establish a colony here. It was only
after they were convinced at Versailles that Coxe, the claimant of the grant
of “Carolana,” was in earnest in his attempts to colonize the banks of the
Mississippi by way of its mouth, that this determination was reached. As
late as the 8th of April, 1699, the Minister of the Marine wrote: “I begin
by telling you that the King does not intend at present to form an establishment
at the mouth of the Mississippi, but only to complete the discovery
in order to hinder the English from taking possession there.” The
same summer Pontchartrain told the Governor of Santo Domingo<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that the
“King would not attempt to occupy the country unless the advantages to
be derived from it should appear to be certain.” La Salle’s expedition
in 1682 had reached the mouth of the river. His Majesty had acquiesced
in it without enthusiasm, and with no conviction of the possible value of
the discovery. He had, indeed, stated that “he did not think that the
explorations which the Canadians were anxious to make would be of much
advantage. He wished, however, that La Salle’s should be pushed to a
conclusion, so that he might judge whether it would be of any use.”</p>

<p>The presence of La Salle in Paris after he had accomplished the journey
down the river had fired the imagination of the old King, and visions of
Spanish conquests and of gold and silver within easy reach had made him
listen readily to a scheme for colonization, and consent to fitting out an
expedition by sea. When the hopes which had accompanied the discoverer
on his outward voyage gave place to accounts of the disasters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which had pursued his expedition, it would seem that the old doubts as
to the value of the Mississippi returned.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It was at this time that Henri
de Tonty, most faithful of followers, asked that he might be appointed
to pursue the discoveries of his old leader.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Tonty was doomed to disappointment.
His influence at Court was not strong enough to secure the
position which he desired. In 1697<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the attention of the Minister of the
Marine was called by Sieur Argoud to a proposition made by Sieur de
Rémonville to form a company for the same purpose. The memorial
of Argoud vouches for Rémonville as a friend of La Salle, sets forth at
length the advantages to be gained by the expedition, explains in detail its
needs, and gives a complete scheme for the formation of the proposed
company. From lack of faith or lack of influence this proposition also
failed. It required the prestige of Iberville’s name, brought to bear in the
same direction, to carry the conviction necessary for success.</p>

<p>Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville was a native of Canada. He was born on
the 16th of July, 1661,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and was reared to a life of adventure. His
name and the names of his brothers, under the titles of their seigniories,
are associated with all the perilous adventure of the day in their native
land. They were looked upon by the Onondagas as brothers and protectors,
and their counsel was always received with respect. Maricourt,
who was several times employed upon important missions to the Iroquois,
was known among them under the symbolic name of Taouistaouisse, or
“little bird which is always in motion.” In 1697, when Iberville urged upon
the minister the arguments which suggested themselves to him in favor of
an expedition in search of the mouth of the Mississippi, he had already
gained distinction in the Valley of the St. Lawrence, upon the shores of the
Atlantic, and on the waters of Hudson’s Bay.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The tales of his wonderful
successes on land and on sea tax the credulity of the reader; and were it
not for the concurrence of testimony, doubts would creep in as to their
truth. It seemed as if the young men of the Le Moyne family felt that
with the death of Frontenac the days of romance and adventure had ended
in Canada; that for the time being, at least, diplomacy was to succeed
daring, and thoughts of trade at Quebec and Montreal were to take the
place of plans for the capture of Boston and New York. To them the
possibility of collision with Spaniards or Englishmen was an inducement
rather than a drawback. Here perhaps, in explorations on the shores of
the Gulf of Mexico, courage and audacity might find those rewards and
honors for which the opportunity was fast disappearing in Canada. Inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
by such sentiments, the enthusiasm of Iberville overcame the reserve of the
King. The grandeur of the scheme began to attract his attention. It was
clear that the French had not only anticipated the English in getting
possession of the upper waters of the great river, but their boats had
navigated its current from source to mouth.</p>

</div>


<p>If they could establish
themselves at its entrance, and were able to control its navigation, they
could hold the whole valley. Associated with these thoughts were hopes
of mines in the distant regions of the upper Mississippi which might
contribute to France wealth equal to that which Spain had drawn from
Mexico. Visions of pearl-fisheries in the Gulf, and wild notions as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
value of buffalo-wool, aided Iberville in his task of convincing the Court
of the advantages to be derived from his proposed voyage.</p>

<p>In June, 1698, two armed vessels were designated for the expedition,&mdash;the
“Badine,” which was put under the command of Iberville, and the
“Marin,” under the Chevalier de Surgères. The correspondence between
the Minister of the Marine and Iberville during the period of preparation
shows that the Court earnestly endeavored to forward the enterprise.</p>

<p>Rumors were rife that summer at Rochelle that an expedition was
fitting out at London<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> for the purpose of establishing a colony of French
Protestants on the banks of the Mississippi. On the 18th of June Iberville
wrote to the Minister to warn him of the fact. He had turned aside as
a joke, he says, the rumors that his expedition was bound to the Mississippi,
and he suggests that orders be sent him to proceed to the River Amazon,
with which he could lay such stories at rest and deceive the English as
to his movements. The instructions with which he was provided allege
that he was selected for the command because of his previous record. He
was left free to prosecute his search for the mouth of the river according
to his own views. After he should have found it, he was to fortify some
spot which should command its entrance. He was to prevent, at all
hazards, any other nation from making a landing there. Should he find
that be had been anticipated in the discovery, still he was to effect a landing
if possible; and in case of inability to do so, he was to make a careful
examination of affairs and report.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th of October, 1698,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the “Badine” and the
“Marin” sailed from Brest, at which port they had put in after leaving
Rochelle. They were accompanied by two transports, which formed a part
of the expedition. The two frigates and one of the transports arrived at
Santo Domingo on the 4th of December. The other transport arrived ten
days after. The frigate “François,” under Chasteaumorand, was here
added to the fleet as an escort to the American coast. On the 31st of
December they sailed from Santo Domingo, and on the 23d of January,
1699, at half-past four in the evening, land was seen distant eight leagues
to the northeast. In the evening fires were observed on shore. Pursuing
a course parallel with the coast, they sailed to the westward by day and
anchored each night. The shore was carefully reconnoitred with small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
boats as they proceeded, and a record of the soundings was kept, of sufficient
accuracy to give an idea of the approach to the coast. On the 26th
they were abreast of Pensacola,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> where they found two Spanish vessels
at anchor, and the port in possession of an armed Spanish force, with
whom they communicated. Still following the coast to the westward, they
anchored on the 31st off the mouth of the Mobile River. Here they remained
for several days, examining the coast and the islands. They called
one of these islands Massacre Island, on account of the large number of
human bones which they found upon it. Not satisfied with the roadstead,
they worked along the coast, sounding and reconnoitring; and on the 10th
of February came to anchor at a spot where the shelter of some islands
furnished a safe roadstead. Preparations were at once begun for the work
of exploration, and on the 13th Iberville left the ships for the mainland in
a boat with eleven men. He was accompanied by his brother Bienville
with two men in a bark canoe which formed part of their equipment.
His first effort was to establish friendly relations with the natives. He had
some difficulty in communicating with them, as his party was mistaken for
Spaniards, with whom the Indians were not on good terms. His knowledge
of Indian ways taught him how to conquer this difficulty. Leaving his
brother and two Canadians as hostages in their hands, he succeeded on the
16th in getting some of the natives to come on board his ship, where he
entertained them by firing off his cannons. On the 17th he returned to the
spot where he had left his brother, and found him carrying on friendly
converse with natives who belonged to tribes then living upon the banks
of the Mississippi. The bark canoe puzzled them; and they asked if the
party came from the upper Mississippi, which in their language they called
the “Malbanchia.” Iberville made an appointment with these Indians to
return with them to the river, and was himself at the rendezvous at the
appointed time; but they failed him. Being satisfied now that he was near
the mouth of the Mississippi, and that he had nothing to fear from the
English, he told Chasteaumorand that he could return to Santo Domingo
with the “François.” On the 21st that vessel sailed for the islands.</p>

<p>On the 27th the party which was to enter the mouth of the river left the
ships. They had two boats, which they speak of as <i>biscayennes</i>, and
two bark canoes. Iberville was accompanied by his brother Bienville,
midshipman on the “Badine;” Sauvolle, <i>enseigne de vaisseau</i> on the
“Marin;” the Récollet father Anastase, who had been with La Salle; and
a party of men,&mdash;stated by himself in one place at thirty-three, and in
another at forty-eight.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 2d of March, 1699, they entered the river,&mdash;the
Malbanchia of the Indians, the Palissado of the Spaniards, the Mississippi
of to-day.</p>

<p>After a careful examination of the mouth of the river, at that time
apparently in flood, Iberville set his little party at the hard work which was
now before them, of stemming the current in their progress up the stream.
His search was now directed toward identifying the river, by comparison
with the published descriptions of Hennepin, and also by means of information
contained in the Journal of Joutel,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which had been submitted to him
in manuscript by Pontchartrain. At the distance, according to observations
of the sun, of sixty-four leagues from the mouth of the river, he reached
the village of the Bayagoulas, some of whom he had already seen. At this
point his last doubt about the identity of the river was dissipated; for he
met a chief of the Mougoulachas clothed in a cloak of blue serge, which
he said was given to him by Tonty. With rare facility, Iberville had
already picked up enough of the language of these Indians to communicate
with them; and Bienville, who had brought a native up the river in his
canoe, could speak the language passably well. “We talked much of what
Tonty had done while there; of the route that he took and of the Quinipissas,
who, they said, lived in seven villages, distant an eight days’ journey
to the northeast of this village by land.” The Indians drew rude maps
of the river and the country, showing that when Tonty left them he had
gone up to the Oumas, and that going and coming he had passed this spot.
They knew nothing of any other branch of the river. These things did not
agree with Hennepin’s account, the truth of which Iberville began to suspect.
He says that he knew that the Récollet father had told barefaced lies
about Canada and Hudson’s Bay in his Relation, yet it seemed incredible
that he should have undertaken to deceive all France on these points.
However that might be, Iberville realized that the first test to be applied to
his own reports would be comparison with other sources of information;
and having failed to find the village of the Quinipissas and the island in the
river, he must by further evidence establish the truth or the falsity of
Hennepin’s account. This was embarrassing. The “Marin” was short
of provisions, Surgères was anxious to return, the position for the settlement
had not yet been selected, and the labor of rowing against the current
was hard on the men, while the progress was very slow. Anxious as
Iberville was to return, the reasons for obtaining further proof that he was
on the Mississippi, with which to convince doubters in France, overcame
his desires, and he kept on his course up the river. On the 20th he reached
the village of the Oumas, and was gratified to learn that the memory of
Tonty’s visit, and of the many presents which he had distributed, was still
fresh in the minds of the natives. Iberville was now, according to his
reckoning, about one hundred leagues up the river. He had been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
procure for his party only Indian corn in addition to the ship’s provisions
with which they started. His men were weary. All the testimony that he
could procure concurred to show that the route by which Tonty came and
went was the same as that which he himself had pursued, and that the
division of the river into two channels was a myth.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> With bitterness of
spirit he inveighs against the Récollet, whose “false accounts had deceived
every one. Time had been consumed, the enterprise hindered, and the
men of the party had suffered in the search after purely imaginary
things.” And yet, if we may accept the record of his Journal, this visit to
the village of the Oumas was the means of his tracing the most valuable
piece of evidence of French explorations in this vicinity which could have
been produced. “The Bayagoulas,” he says, “seeing that I persisted in
wishing to search for the fork and also insisted that Tonty had not passed
by there, explained to me that he had left with the chief of the Mougoulachas
a writing enclosed for some man who was to come from the sea,
which was similar to one that I myself had left with them.” The urgency
of the situation compelled Iberville’s return to the ships. On his way back
he completed the circuit of the island on which New Orleans was afterward
built, by going through the river named after himself and through Lake
Pontchartrain. The party which accompanied him consisted of four men,
and they travelled in two canoes. The two boats proceeded down the
Mississippi, with orders to procure the letter from the Mougoulachas and
to sound the passes at the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>On the 31st both expeditions reached the ships. Iberville had the
satisfaction of receiving from the hands of his brother<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the letter which
Tonty had left for La Salle, bearing date, “At the village of the Quinipissas,
April 20, 1685.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The contents of the letter were of little moment, but its
possession was of great value to Iberville. The doubts of the incredulous
must yield to proof of this nature. Here was Tonty’s account of his trip
down the river, of his search along the coast for traces of his old leader,
and of his reluctant conclusion that his mission was a failure. In the midst
of the clouds of treachery which obscure the last days of La Salle, the form
of Tonty looms up, the image of steadfast friendship and genuine devotion.
“Although,” he says, “we have neither heard news nor seen signs of you,
I do not despair that God will grant success to your undertakings. I wish
it with all my heart; for you have no more faithful follower than myself,
who would sacrifice everything to find you.”</p>

<p>After his return to the ships, Iberville hastened to choose a spot for
a fortification. In this he experienced great difficulty; but he finally
selected Biloxi, where a defence of wood was rapidly constructed and by
courtesy called a fort. A garrison of seventy men and six boys was landed,
with stores, guns, and ammunition. Sauvolle, <i>enseigne de vaisseau du roy</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
“a discreet young man of merit,” was placed in command. Bienville, “my
brother,” then eighteen years old, was left second in rank, as <i>lieutenant
du roy</i>. The main object of the expedition was accomplished. The
“Badine” and the “Marin” set sail for France on the 3d of May, 1699.
For Iberville, as he sailed on the homeward passage, there was the task,
especially difficult for him, of preparing a written report of his success.
For Sauvolle and the little colony left behind, there was the hard problem
to solve, how they should manage with scant provisions and with no prospect
of future supply. So serious was this question that in a few days
a transport was sent to Santo Domingo for food. This done, they set to
work exploring the neighborhood and cultivating the friendship of the
neighboring tribes of Indians. To add to their discomforts, while still short
of provisions they were visited by two Canadian missionaries who were
stationed among the Tonicas and Taensas in the Mississippi Valley. The
visitors had floated down the river in canoes, having eighteen men in all in
their company, and arrived at Biloxi in the month of July. Ten days they
had lived in their canoes, and during the trip from the mouth of the river
to Biloxi their sufferings for fresh water had been intense. Such was the
price paid to satisfy their craving for a sight of their compatriots who were
founding a settlement at the mouth of the river. On the 15th of September,
while Bienville was reconnoitring the river at a distance of about twenty-three
leagues from its mouth, he was astonished by the sight of an armed
English ship of twelve guns.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This was one of the fleet despatched by
Coxe, the claimant of the grant from the English Government of the
province of Carolana.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The rumor concerning which Iberville had written
to the Minister the year before had proved true. Bienville found no difficulty
in persuading the captain that he was anticipated, that the country
was already in possession of the French, and that he had better abandon
any attempt to make a landing. The English captain yielded; but not
without a threat of intention to return, and an assertion of prior English
discovery. The bend in the river where this occurred was named English
Turn. The French refugees, unable to secure homes in the Mississippi
Valley under the English flag, petitioned to be permitted to do so as French
citizens.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The most Christian King was not fond of Protestant colonists,
and replied that he had not chased heretics out of his kingdom to create
a republic for them in America. Charlevoix states that the same refugees
renewed their offers to the Duke of Orleans when regent, who also,
rejected them.</p>

<p>Iberville, who had been sent out a second time, arrived at Biloxi
Dec. 7, 1699. This time his instructions were, to examine the discoveries
made by Sauvolle and Bienville during his absence, and report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
thereon. He was to bring back samples of buffalo-wool, of pearls, and
of ores.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He was to report on the products of the country, and to see
whether the native women and children could be made use of to rear silk-worms.
An attempt to propagate buffaloes was ordered to be made at the
fort. His report was to determine the question whether the establishment
should be continued or abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Sauvolle was confirmed as “Commandant
of the Fort of the Bay of Biloxi and its environs,” and Bienville as
<i>lieutenant du roy</i>. Bienville’s report about the English ship showed the importance
of fortifying the entrance of the river. A spot was selected about
eighteen leagues from the mouth, and a fort was laid out. While they
were engaged in its construction Tonty arrived. He had made his final
trip down the river, from curiosity to see what was going on at its mouth.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The colony was now fairly established, and, notwithstanding the reluctance
of the King, was to remain. Bienville retained his position as second
in rank, but was stationed at the post on the river. Surgères was despatched
to France. Iberville himself, before his return, made a trip up the
river to visit the Natchez and the Taensas. He was shocked, while with the
latter tribe, at the sacrifice of the lives of several infants on the occasion
of the temple being struck by lightning. He reported that the plants and
trees that he had brought from France were doing well, but that the sugar-canes
from the islands did not put forth shoots.</p>

<p>With the return of Iberville to France, in the spring of 1700, the romantic
interest which has attached to his person while engaged in these preliminary
explorations ceases, and we no longer watch his movements with the same
care. His third voyage, which occupied from the fall of 1701 to the summer
of 1702, was devoid of interest. On this occasion he anchored his fleet at
Pensacola, proceeding afterward with one of his vessels to Mobile. A period
of inaction in the affairs of the colony follows, coincident with the war of the
Spanish Succession, during which the settlement languished, and its history
can be told in few words. Free transportation from France to Louisiana
was granted to a few unfortunate women and children, relatives of colonists.
Some Canadians with Indian wives came down the river with their families.
Thus a semblance of a settlement was formed. Bienville succeeded to the
command, death having removed Sauvolle from his misery in the fall of
1701. The vitality of the wretched troops was almost equally sapped,
whether stationed at the fort on the spongy foothold by the river side, or
on the glaring sands of the gently sloping beach at Biloxi. Fishing, hunting,
searching for pearls, and fitting out expeditions to discover imaginary
mines occupied the time and the thoughts of the miserable colonists; while
the sages across the water still pressed upon their attention the possibility
of developing the trade in buffalo-wool, on which they built their hopes
of the future of the colony. Agriculture was totally neglected; but hunting-parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and embassies to Indians explored the region now covered by
the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Le Sueur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
explored the upper Mississippi in search of mines. In 1700 Bienville and
Saint-Denys scoured the Red River country in search of Spaniards, but saw
none. In 1701 Saint-Denys was gone for six months on a trip to the same
region, with the same result.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The records of these expeditions and the
Relations of the fathers have preserved for us a knowledge of the country
as it then was, and of the various tribes which then inhabited the Valley of
the Mississippi. From them we obtain descriptions of the curious temples
of the Natchez and Taensas; of the perpetual fire preserved in them; of the
custom of offering as a sacrifice the first-fruits of the chase and the field; of
the arbitrary despotism of their grand chief, or Sun; of the curious hereditary
aristocracy transmitted through the female Suns;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of the strange custom
of sacrificing human lives on the death of a Grand Sun. To be selected
to accompany the chief to the other world was a privilege as well as a duty;
to avoid its performance when through ties of blood or from other cause
the selection was involuntary, was a disgrace and a dishonor.</p>

<p>We find records of the presence of no less than four of the Le Moyne
brothers,&mdash;Iberville, Bienville, Sérigny, and Chateauguay. Iberville was
rewarded in 1699 by appointment as chevalier of the Order of St. Louis; in
1702 by promotion to the position of <i>capitaine de vaisseau</i>; and in 1703
he was appointed commander-in-chief of the colony, which Pontchartrain in
his official announcement calls “the colony of Mississippi.” These honors
did not quite meet his expectations. He wanted a concession, with the
title of count; the privilege of sending a ship to Guinea for negroes;
a lead mine; in short, he wanted a number of things. He bore within his
frame the seeds of disease contracted in the south; and in 1706, while
employed upon a naval expedition against the English, he succumbed at
Havana to an attack of yellow fever. With him departed much of the life
and hope of the colony. Supplies, which during his life had never been
abundant, were now sure to be scarce; and we begin to find in the records
of the colony the monotonous, reiterated complaints of scarcity of provisions.
These wails are occasionally relieved by accounts of courtesies
exchanged with the Spanish settlements at Pensacola and St. Augustine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
The war of the Spanish Succession had brought Spain and France close
together. The Spanish forts stood in the pathway of the English and
protected Biloxi. When the Spanish commander called for help, Bienville
responded with men and ammunition; and when starvation fairly stared the
struggling Spanish settlement in the face, he shared with them his scant
food. They in turn reciprocated, and a regular debit and credit account
of these favors was kept, which was occasionally adjusted by commissioners
thereto duly appointed. So few were the materials of which histories are
ordinarily composed, during these years of torpor and inaction, that one
of the historians of that time thus epitomizes a period of over a year:
“During the rest of this year and all of the next nothing new happened
except the arrival of some brigantines from Martinique, Rochelle, and
Santo Domingo, which brought provisions and drinks which they found
it easy to dispose of.”</p>

<p>France was too deeply engaged in the struggle with England to forward
many emigrants. Canada could furnish but a scant population for the
scattered settlements from Cape Breton to the Mississippi. The hardy
adventurers who had accompanied Iberville in his search for the mouth
of the Mississippi, and the families which had drifted down from Illinois,
were as many as could be procured from her, and more than she could
spare. The unaccustomed heat of the climate and the fatal fevers which
lurked in the Southern swamps told upon the health of the Canadians, and
sickness thinned their ranks. In the midst of the pressure of impending
disasters which threatened the declining years of the most Christian King,
the tardy enthusiasm in behalf of the colony, which his belief in its pearls
and its buffalo-wool had aroused, caused him to spare from the resources
of a bankrupt kingdom the means to equip and forward to the colony a
vessel laden with supplies and bearing seventy-five soldiers and four priests.
The tax upon the kingdom for even so feeble a contribution was enough
to be felt at such a time; but the result was hardly worth the effort.
The vessel arrived in July, 1704, during a period of sickness. Half of her
crew died. To assist in navigating her back to France twenty soldiers
were furnished. During the month of September the prevailing epidemic
carried off the brave Tonty and thirty of the newly arrived soldiers. Given
seventy-five soldiers as an increase to the force of a colony, which in
1701 was reported to number only one hundred and fifty persons, deduct
twenty required to work the ship back, and thirty more for death within
six weeks after arrival, and the net result which we obtain is not favorable
for the rapid growth of the settlement. The same ship, in addition to
supplies, soldiers, and priests, brought other cargo; namely, two Gray
Sisters, four families of artisans, and twenty-three poor girls. The “poor
girls” were all married to the resident Canadians within thirty days. With
the exception of the visit of a frigate in 1701, and the arrival of a store-ship
in 1703, this vessel is the only arrival outside of Iberville’s expeditions
which is recorded in the <i>Journal historique</i> up to that date. The wars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rumors of wars between the Indians soon disclosed a state of things at the
South which in some of its features resembled the situation at the North.
The Cherokees and Chickasaws were so placed geographically that they
came in contact with English traders from Carolina and Virginia. Penicaut,
when on his way up the river with Le Sueur, met one of these
enterprising merchants among the Arkansas, of whom he says, “We found
an English trader here who was of great assistance in obtaining provisions
for us, as our stock was rapidly declining.” Le Sueur says, “I asked him
who sent him here. He showed me a passport from the governor of
Carolina, who, he said, claimed to be master of the river.” Thus English
traders were here stumbling-blocks to the French precisely as they had
been farther north. Their influence appears to have been used in stirring
up the Indians to hostile acts, just as in New York the Iroquois were
incited to attack the Canadians. The Choctaws, a powerful tribe, were
on the whole friendly to the French. The wars in Louisiana were not so
disastrous to the French as the raids of the Five Nations had proved in
the Valley of the St. Lawrence. The vengeance of the Chickasaws was
easily sated with a few Choctaw scalps, and perhaps with the capture of
a few Indian women and children whom they could sell to the English
settlers in Carolina as slaves. Hence the number of French lives lost in
these attacks was insignificant.</p>

<p>The territory of Louisiana was no more vague and indefinite than its
form of government. Even its name was long in doubt. It was indifferently
spoken of as Louisiana or Mississippi in many despatches. Sauvolle
was left as commander of the post when Iberville returned to France
after his first voyage. In this office he was confirmed, and Bienville succeeded
to the same position. True, the post was the colony then, but
when Iberville was in Louisiana it was he who negotiated with the
Indians; it was he of whom the Company of Canada complained for interfering
with the trade in beaver-skins; it was he whom the Court evidently
looked upon as the head of the colony even before he was formally
appointed to the chief command. This chaotic state of affairs not only
produced confusion, but it engendered jealousies and fostered quarrels.
The Company of Canada found fault with Iberville for interfering with the
beaver trade. The Governor of Canada claimed that Louisiana should
be brought under his jurisdiction. Iberville insisted that the boundaries
should be defined; and complained that the Canadians belittled him with
the Indians when the two colonies clashed, by contrasting Canadian liberality
with his poverty.</p>

<p>Le Sueur, who by express orders had accompanied
Iberville on his second voyage, was holding a fort on the upper Mississippi
at the same time that “Juchereau de Saint-Denys,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> lieutenant-général de la

mine for lead and copper. One Nicolas de la Salle, a purser in the naval
service, was sent over to perform the duties of <i>commissaire</i>. The office of
<i>commissaire-ordonnateur</i> was the equivalent of the intendant,&mdash;a counterpoise
to the governor and a spy upon his actions. La Salle’s relation to this
office was apparently the same as Bienville’s to the position of governor.
A purser performed the duties of <i>commissaire</i>; a midshipman, those of commanding
officer. Of course La Salle’s presence in the colony could only
breed trouble; and we find him reporting that “Iberville, Bienville, and
Chateauguay, the three brothers, are thieves and knaves capable of all
sorts of misdeeds.” Bienville, on his part, complains that “M. de la Salle,
purser, would not give Chateauguay pay for services performed by order
of the minister.” This state of affairs needed amendment. Iberville had
never reported in the colony after his appointment in 1703 as commander-in-chief.
Bienville had continued at the actual head of affairs. In February,
1708, it was ascertained in the colony that M. de Muys had started
from France to supersede Bienville, but had died on the way.</p>

<p>M. Diron d’Artaguette, who had been appointed <i>commissaire-ordonnateur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
with orders to examine into the conduct of the officers of the
colony and to report upon the condition of its affairs, arrived in Mobile
in February, 1708. An attempt had apparently been made to organize
Louisiana on the same system as prevailed in the other colonies. Artaguette
made his investigation, and returned to France in 1711. During
his brief stay the monotony of the record had been varied by the raid of
an English privateer upon Dauphin (formerly Massacre) Island, where a
settlement had been made in 1707 and fortified in 1709. The peripatetic
capital had been driven, by the manifest unfitness of the situation, from
Biloxi to a point on the Mobile River, from which it was now compelled
by floods to move to higher lands eight leagues from the mouth of the
river. No variation was rung upon the chronic complaint of scarcity of
provisions. The frequent changes in the position of headquarters, lack
of faith in the permanence of the establishment, and the severe attacks
of fever endured each year by many of the settlers, discouraged those who
might otherwise have given their attention to agriculture. To meet this
difficulty, Bienville proposed to send Indians to the islands, there to be
exchanged for negroes. If his plan had met with approval, perhaps he
might have made the colony self-supporting, and thus have avoided in
1710 the scandal of subsisting his men by scattering them among the very
savages whom he wished to sell into slavery. It is not to be wondered
at that the growth of the colony under these circumstances was very slow.
In 1701 the number of inhabitants was stated at one hundred and fifty.
In 1708 La Salle reported the population as composed of a garrison of
one hundred and twenty-two persons, including priests, workmen, and boys;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
seventy-seven inhabitants, men, women, and children; and eighty Indian
slaves. In 1712 there were four hundred persons, including twenty negroes.
Some of the colonists had accumulated a little property, and Bienville
reported that he was obliged to watch them lest they should go away.</p>

<p>On the 14th day of September, 1712, and of his reign the seventieth
year, Louis, by the grace of God king of France and Navarre, granted
to Sieur Antony Crozat the exclusive right to trade in all the lands possessed
by him and bounded by New Mexico and by the lands of the
English of Carolina; in all the establishments, ports, havens, rivers, and
principally the port and haven of the Isle of Dauphin, heretofore called
Massacre, the River St. Louis, heretofore called the Mississippi, from the
edge of the sea as far as the Illinois, together with the River of St. Philip,
heretofore called the Missouri, and of the St. Jerome, heretofore called
the Ouabache, with all the countries, territories, lakes within land, and
the rivers which fall directly or indirectly into that part of the River St.
Louis. Louisiana thus defined was to remain a separate colony, subordinate,
however, to the Government of New France. The exclusive grant
of trade was to last for fifteen years. Mines were granted in perpetuity
subject to a royalty, and to forfeiture if abandoned. Lands could be taken
for settlement, manufactures, or for cultivation; but if abandoned they
reverted to the Crown. It was provided in Article XIV., “if for the farms
and plantations which the said Sieur Crozat wishes to carry on he finds
it desirable to have some negroes in the said country of Louisiana, he may
send a ship each year to trade for them directly on the coast of Guinea,
taking a permit from the Guinea Company so to do. He may sell these
negroes to the inhabitants of the colony of Louisiana, and we forbid all
other companies and persons whatsoever, under any pretence whatsoever,
to introduce any negroes or traffic for them in the said country, nor shall
the said Crozat carry any negroes elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Crozat was a man of commercial instinct,&mdash;developed, however, only to
the standard of the times. The grant to him of these extensive privileges
was acknowledged in the patent to have been made for financial favors
received by the King, and also because the King believed that a successful
business man would be able to manage the affairs of the colony. The
value of the grant was dependent upon the extent to which Crozat could
develop the commerce of the settlement; and he seems to have set to work
in earnest to test its possibilities. The journals of the colonists now record
the arrivals of vessels with stores, provisions, and passengers. Supplies
were maintained during this commercial administration upon a more liberal
basis. The fear of starvation was for the time postponed, and the colonists
were spared the humiliation of depending for means of subsistence upon
the labor of those whom they termed savages. Merchandise was imported,
and only purchasers were needed to complete the transaction.
There being no possible legal competition for peltries within the limits
of the colony, the market price was what the monopolist chose to pay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Louis XIV. had forbidden “all persons and companies of all kinds, whatever
their quality and condition, and whatever the pretext might be, from
trading in Louisiana under pain of confiscation of goods and ships, and
perhaps of other and severer punishments.” Yet so oblivious were the
English traders of their impending fate that they continued to trade among
the tribes which were friendly to them, and at times even went so far as to
encroach upon the trade with the tribes allied to the French and fairly
within French lines. So negligent were the <i>coureurs de bois</i> of their own
interest, that when Crozat put the price of peltries below what the
English and Spanish traders were paying, they would work their way to
Charleston and to Pensacola. So indifferent were the Spaniards to a commerce
not carried on in their own ships, and so thoroughly did they believe
in the principles of the grant to Crozat, that they would not permit his
vessels to trade in their ports. Thus it
happened that La Mothe Cadillac, who
had arrived in the colony in May, 1713,
bearing his own commission as governor,
was soon convinced that the commerce
of the colony was limited to the sale of
vegetables to the Spaniards at Pensacola,
and the interchange of a few products with the islands. His disappointment
early showed itself in his despatches. His selection for the post was
unfortunate. By persistent pressure he had succeeded while in Canada
in convincing the Court of the necessity for a post at Detroit and of the
propriety of putting La Mothe Cadillac in charge of it. He had upon his
hands at that time a chronic war with the priests, whose work he belittled
in his many letters. His reputation in this respect was so well known that
the inhabitants of Montreal in a protest against the establishment of the
post at Detroit alleged that he was “known not to be in the odor of
sanctity.” He had carried his prejudices with him to that isolated post,
and had flooded the archives with correspondence, memoranda, and reports
stamped with evidence of his impatience and lack of policy. The vessel
which brought him to Louisiana brought also another instalment of marriageable
girls. Apparently they were not so attractive as the first lot.
Some of them remained single so long that the officials were evidently
doubtful about finding them husbands. By La Mothe’s orders, according
to Penicaut, the MM. de la Loire were instructed to establish a trading-post
at Natchez in 1713. A post in Alabama called Fort Toulouse was
established in 1714.</p>

<p>Saint-Denys in 1714 and again in 1716 went to Mexico. His first expedition
was evidently for the purpose of opening commercial relations with
the Spaniards. No signs of Spanish occupation were met by the party till
they reached the vicinity of the Rio Grande. This visit apparently roused
the Spaniards to the necessity of occupying Texas, for they immediately
sent out an expedition from Mexico to establish a number of missions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in that region. Saint-Denys, who on his return accompanied this expedition,
was evidently satisfied that the Spanish authorities would permit
traffic with the posts in New Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> A trading expedition was
promptly organized by him in the fall of 1716 and despatched within
a few months of his return. This expedition on its way to the presidio
on the Rio Grande passed through several Indian towns in the “province
of Lastekas,” where they found Spanish priests and Spanish soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Either Saint-Denys had been deceived, or the Spanish Government had
changed its views. The goods of the expedition were seized and confiscated.
Saint-Denys himself went to Mexico to secure their release, if
possible. His companions returned to Louisiana. Meantime La Mothe
had in January, 1717, sent a sergeant and six soldiers to occupy the
Island of Natchitoches.</p>

<p>While the French and Spanish traders and soldiers were settling down
on the Red River and in Texas, in the posts and missions which were to
determine the boundaries between Texas and Louisiana, La Mothe himself
was not idle. In 1715 he went up to Illinois in search of silver mines. He
brought back lead ore, but no silver. In 1716 the tribe of the Natchez
showed signs of restlessness, and attacked some of the French. Bienville
was sent with a small force of thirty-four soldiers and fifteen sailors to bring
this powerful tribe to terms. He succeeded by deceit in accomplishing
what he could not have done by fighting, and actually compelled the
Indians, through fear for the lives of some chiefs whom he had treacherously
seized, to construct a fort on their own territory, the sole purpose
of which was to hold them in awe. From that date a garrison was maintained
at Natchez. Bienville, who was then commissioned as “Commandant
of the Mississippi and its tributaries,” was expected to make
this point his headquarters. The jealousy between himself and La Mothe
had ripened into open quarrel. The latter covered reams of paper with
his crisp denunciations of affairs in Louisiana, until Crozat, worn out with
his complaints, finally wrote, “I am of opinion that all the disorders in
the colony of which M. de la Mothe complains proceed from his own
maladministration of affairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>No provision was made in the early days of the colony for the establishment
of a legal tribunal; military law alone prevailed. By an edict issued
Dec. 18, 1712, the governor and <i>commissaire-ordonnateur</i> were constituted
a tribunal for three years from the day of its meeting, with the
same powers as the councils of Santo Domingo and Martinique. The
tribunal was afterward re-established with increased numbers and more
definite powers.</p>

<p>On the 23d day of August, 1717, the Regent accepted a proposition
made to him by Sieur Antony Crozat to remit the remainder of the term
of his exclusive privilege. Although it must have wounded the pride of
a man like Crozat to acknowledge that so gigantic a scheme, fraught with
such exaggerated hopes and possibilities, was a complete failure, yet there
is no record of his having undertaken to save himself by means of the
annual shipload of negroes which he was authorized, under Article XIV.
of his grant, to import. The late King had simply granted him permission
to traffic in human beings. It remained for the Regent representing the
Grand Monarque’s great-grandson to
convert this permission into an absolute
condition in the grant to the Company
to which Crozat’s rights were assigned.
The population of the colony was estimated
at seven hundred of all ages,
sexes, and colors, not including natives,
when in March, 1717, the affairs of government were turned over to
L’Epinay, the successor of La Mothe.</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>The charter of the Company of the West, which succeeded to Crozat’s
rights, was registered on the 6th of September, 1717. The formation of
the Company was based upon an ingenious attempt to fund in the shape
of <i>rentes</i>&mdash;practically a form of annuity bonds&mdash;that portion of the debt
of the kingdom then outstanding as <i>billets d’état</i>. Louis XIV., at his death,
had left the nation encumbered with a debt generally estimated at about
2,500,000,000, but rated above 3,000,000,000 livres<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> by some writers. His
necessities had compelled him to exhaust every possible means of raising
money, even to pledging specifically in advance large portions of the
revenue for several years. A floating debt of about 600,000,000 livres
was arbitrarily scaled down by the Regent to 250,000,000, and placed in
the form known as <i>billets d’état</i>. Even after this reduction the new securities
were at a discount of from 60 to 70 per cent. It was to provide relief
from this condition of affairs that the Company of the West was inaugurated.
The capital stock was divided into shares of five hundred livres
each. The number of shares was not limited in the original edict. Payment
for them was made exclusively in <i>billets d’état</i>. For these <i>billets</i>,
when surrendered to the Government in sums of one million livres, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
were issued to the Company <i>rentes</i> in perpetuity for forty thousand livres.
The State was relieved from the pressure of so much of its debt as was thus
used, by assuming the payment of 4 per cent interest upon the principal.
To secure this interest money certain revenues of the Government were
pledged. Thus the Company had an income of 4 per cent upon its capital
guaranteed by Government. If the Louisiana grant was worth anything, all
that could be made out of it was an additional temptation to the investor.
That grant consisted of a monopoly of the commerce of the colony and
of the absolute control of its affairs, the proprietorship of all lands that
they should improve, and the ownership of mines. The privilege of granting
lands free from all feudal obligation was expressly permitted. The
protection of the Government was guaranteed to the servants of the Company.
During the existence of the charter, which was for twenty-five
years from the date of registration, property in Louisiana was to be
exempt from taxation. With the exception of the condition to import
six thousand white persons and three thousand negroes, this vast gift was
practically unencumbered. To these privileges was also added the exclusive
right to purchase beavers in Canada. The more readily to float the
capital, the shares of aliens were exempt from the <i>droit d’aubaine</i> and from
confiscation in time of war.</p>

<p>The name of Law, director-general of the bank, led the list of directors
nominated in the royal edict. On the death of Louis XIV. this famous
Scotchman had offered his services to the Regent, and by ready wit and
plausible arguments had convinced him that measures could be taken which
would help the State carry the heavy load of debt with which it was burdened.
The foundation, on the 2d of May, 1716, of a private bank of issue
with a capital of 6,000,000 livres, was an experimental step. The shares
of this bank were to be paid for, 25 per cent in coin and 75 per cent in the
<i>billets d’état</i>. The redemption of each bank-note was promised in coin
of the same weight and standard as the coinage of its date. At a time
when changes were frequent in the weight and alloy of coin, this feature
made the notes of the bank nominally more stable than the coinage of
the realm.</p>

<p>Law’s fundamental idea was that the prosperity of a community was
proportionate to the amount of the circulating medium, and that good faith
would cause paper to be preferred to coin for this purpose. In his communications
to the Regent he recognized the relation of supply and
demand to the subject. His proposition was to establish a government
bank of issue which should act as the royal treasurer. The distrust of
the Regent led him at first to decline this enterprise, but permission was
given to Law to found a private bank. Under the conservative restrictions
with which it was surrounded, the experimental bank was successful. The
withdrawal of Crozat furnished opportunity to overcome the scruples of the
Regent by substituting for the proposed royal bank a commercial company,
whose stock, according to the original plan, was to be purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
exclusively with <i>billets d’état</i>, which, as before shown, were to be converted
into 4 per cent <i>rentes</i> payable half-yearly. An avenue was thus
opened for the use of the <i>billets</i>. If holders availed themselves of it, the
Government would not only be relieved from their pressure, but also from
the discredit of their heavy discount. It was known that Crozat had
abandoned the grant because he could not make money out of it. It was
evident that capital and patience were necessary to develop the commerce
of Louisiana. Of money the Company received none from original subscriptions
to its stock, although by the terms of the edict the interest for
the year 1717 was to be reserved as a working capital. Doubts as to whether
this would be sufficient to develop the colony made investors wary at first
of its subscription lists. It was soon found necessary to define the amount
of capital stock. This was fixed at 100,000,000 livres by an edict registered
in December, 1717. The grant in August, 1718, of the right to farm the tobacco,
and the extension of this right from six to nine years in September
of the same year, served to quicken popular interest in the Company.</p>

<p>Law’s bank having proved a pronounced success, the Regent was converted
to his scheme, the shareholders of the General Bank were reimbursed,
and it was converted into the Royal Bank. All limit upon the
power to issue bills was by this step practically removed. The character
of the coin in which the bills were to be redeemed was no longer limited
to the livre of the weight and standard of the date of the note, but was
changed to the livre of Tours. The very restraints which had operated
to give that confidence which Law had pronounced essential for a paper-money
circulation were thus removed.</p>

<p>In quick succession the companies of Senegal, of the East Indies, of
China, and of Africa were absorbed by the cormorant Company of the
West. Its title was changed to “the Company of the Indies.” The profits
of the mint and the general farms were purchased, and by a series of edicts
the management of nearly all the financial affairs of the kingdom were
lodged in the Company. Meantime France had been deluged with a flood
of notes<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> from the Royal Bank. The great abundance of money had
lowered interest and revived business. To meet the various payments
which the Company had assumed for the privileges which it had purchased,
as well as to satisfy the increasing demand for shares, the capital
was increased by a series of edicts in the fall of 1719 to 600,000 shares.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Outstanding debts of the Government to the extent of 1,500,000,000 livres
were ordered to be redeemed, and in place thereof new <i>rentes</i> were to be
issued to the Company at 3 per cent. After the first subscription, payment
for stock had been stipulated in coin or bank-notes, in place of <i>billets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
d’état</i>. The various privileges acquired by the Company had been granted
one by one, and their accumulation had been slow enough to enable the
public to appreciate their value and to comprehend the favor in which the
Company was held by the Regent. Subscribers for new shares were therefore
found with increasing ease after each new grant. The demand for the
stock enabled the Company to place each new issue on the market at premiums.
The later issues were at ten times the par value.</p>

<p>The price of the
stock was still further inflated on the market by requiring as a condition
precedent for subscriptions to the new issues, that persons desiring to subscribe
should be holders of a certain number of shares of the old stock for
each share of the new. Subscriptions were in turn stimulated by spreading
the payments over a protracted period, on the instalment plan, thus enabling
persons of small capital who wished to profit by the upward movement of
the stock to operate on margins. To the competition fostered by these
ingenious and at that time novel devices was now added the pressure for new
shares on the part of those whose investments had been disturbed by the
redemption of the <i>rentes</i>. Their demand that some favor be shown them in
the matter of subscriptions was recognized, and edicts were issued which
removed the stipulation that payments should be made in coin or bank-notes;
and in their place <i>billets d’état</i>, notes of the common treasury, and
orders on the cashier of the Company given in liquidation of Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
obligations, were ordered to be received. Shares rose to ten thousand
francs,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and even higher; and those who paid for original shares in discredited
<i>billets d’état</i> could now realize forty times their purchase-money.
The temptation to those of conservative disposition to realize their profits
and convert them into coin or property now burst the bubble. For a time
the Company, by purchasing its own stock, was able to check the impending
disaster; but in spite of all efforts of this sort, and notwithstanding
edict after edict ordaining the compulsory circulation of the notes and
demonetizing gold and silver, the bank, which had in the mean time been
placed under control of the Company, collapsed. The promoter of the
scheme, in the same year that he was controller-general of the finances of
France, was a fugitive and almost a pauper.</p>

<p>During the progress of these events Louisiana had become the scene
of active emigration, ludicrously small when compared with its great
domain, but active beyond any preceding movement of population on the
part of the French. On the 9th of February, 1718, three vessels despatched
by the Company arrived at Dauphin Island, bearing troops and colonists,
and also conveying to Bienville<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the welcome news that he was appointed
<i>commandant-général</i>. In September, 1717,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Illinois had been detached
from New France and incorporated with Louisiana. Boisbriant, who was
appointed to the command of that province, did not assume the government
until the fall of 1718. The Company set to work honestly to develop the
resources of the country. Engineers were sent over to superintend the construction
of public works. The pass at the mouth of the river was to be
mapped, and two little towers were ordered to be erected “at the entrance
to the river, sufficiently high to be seen from afar during the day, and upon
which fire can be made at night.” The coast was to be surveyed, and orders
were given to effect a landing at St. Joseph’s Bay,&mdash;a step which was taken
only to be followed by its prompt abandonment. Concessions were made
to many distinguished men in France, with conditions attached to each that
a certain number of colonists should be imported. Unfortunately for the
influence of these grants upon the future of the colony, it was not required
that the grantees themselves should live upon their concessions. The
grant to Law, twelve miles square, was situated on the Arkansas River. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
agreement, he undertook to introduce fifteen hundred settlers. Vessels
began now to arrive with frequency, bringing involuntary as well as voluntary
emigrants. The power of the courts in France was invoked, apparently
with success, to secure numbers for Louisiana, without regard to
character. Vagrants and convicts, considered dangerous for French society,
were thought suitable for colonists. These steps were soon followed
by complaints from the colony of the worthlessness of such settlers and of
the little reliance that could be placed upon them in military service.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Raynal, in his vigorous way, characterizes them as “the scum of Europe,
which France had, as it were, vomited forth into the New World at the
time of Law’s system.”</p>

<p>The new commanding general sent a force of mechanics and convicts
in February, 1718, to clear the territory now occupied by the city of New
Orleans, and to lay the foundations of a new settlement.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The channel at
Dauphin Island having been blocked by a storm, the headquarters of the
colony were removed, first to Old Biloxi, and afterward by order of the
Company in 1719, to New Biloxi. During the fall of 1718 MM. Benard de
la Harpe and Le Page du Pratz, whose names are associated with the annals
of Louisiana, both arrived in the colony. The pages of the chroniclers of
colonial events are now sprinkled with the names of ships which arrived
with troops and emigrants, including young women from the hospitals and
prisons of Paris. On the 6th of June, 1719, two vessels arrived direct
from the coast of Guinea with “five hundred head of negroes.” The Company
had entered with fervor upon the performance of the stipulation
imposed by the charter.</p>

<p>The news of the war between France and Spain reached the colony in
the spring of 1719. The inconvenience of the roadsteads occupied by the
French had made them anxious to possess Pensacola. Iberville had urged
upon the Government the necessity of procuring its cession from Spain if
possible. So forcible were his arguments that negotiations to that end had
been opened by Pontchartrain.</p>

<p>Although the settlement had been neglected
by the Spanish Government, yet the proposition to cede it to France was
rejected with pompous arguments, in which the title of Spain was asserted
as dating back to the famous Bull of Alexander VI., dividing the newly discovered
portions of the world between Spain and Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Upon receipt

<p>The episodes of the
capture of Pensacola by the French, its recapture by the Spaniards, the
desertion of a large part of the French garrison, the successful resistance
of Sérigny to the siege of Dauphin Island by a Spanish fleet, the opportune
arrival of a French fleet, and the capture again of Pensacola, furnished
occupation and excitement to the colonists for a few months, but had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>

For several years the French at Natchitoches, and the Spaniards a few
miles off at the Mission of the Adaes, had lived peacefully side by side.
The French lieutenant in command of the post took advantage of the outbreak
of hostilities to destroy the Spanish Mission. It was, however, immediately
reoccupied by the Spaniards in force, and was permanently
retained by them. In Illinois, through the arrival of a band of Missouris
who had come to chant the calumet bedecked in chasubles and stoles,
and tricked out in the paraphernalia of the altar, Boisbriant learned that a
Spanish expedition from Santa Fé, in 1720, had been completely annihilated
by these savages.</p>

<p>Far more important in their effect upon the prosperity of the colony than
any question of capture or occupation which arose during these hostilities
were the ordinances passed by the Company of the West, on the 25th of
April, 1719, in which were announced the fixed prices at which supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
would be furnished to inhabitants at different points, and the arbitrary
amounts that would be paid at the same places for peltries, tobacco, flour,
and such other articles as the Company would receive. Gayarré summarizes
the condition of the colonists under these rules as follows: “Thus the
unfortunates who were sent to Louisiana had to brave not only the insalubrity
of the climate and the cruelty of the savages, but in addition they were
held in a condition of oppressive slavery. They could only buy of the Company
at the Company’s price. They could only sell to the Company for such
sum as it chose to pay; and they could only leave the colony by permission
of the Company.” Whites brought from Europe and blacks brought from
Africa “worked equally for one master,&mdash;the all-powerful Company.”</p>

<p>Through a title based upon La Salle’s occupation in 1685, strengthened
by the explorations of Bienville and Saint-Denys in 1700, the subsequent
journeys of Saint-Denys in 1701, 1714, and 1716, and the occupation of
Natchitoches, the French laid claim to a large part of what now constitutes
Texas. Benard de la Harpe left Dauphin Island toward the end of
August, 1718, with fifty men, to establish a post on his concession at Cadodaquais.
He settled on land of the Nassonites, eighty leagues in a straight
line from Natchitoches. He was instructed to open up trade with the
neighboring Spaniards, and through him Bienville forwarded a letter to
the Spanish Governor. A correspondence ensued between La Harpe and
the Governor at Trinity River, in which each expressed doubts as to the
right of the other to be where he was. La Harpe closed it with an assurance
that he could be found in command of his fort, and could convince
the Governor that he knew how to defend it. No overt act followed this
fiery correspondence, and La Harpe shortly after went on an extended
tour of exploration to the northward and westward of his concession. We
hear no more of this post from French sources; but Spanish authorities
assert that after the Mission at Adaes was broken up, the Spaniards returned
with an armed force and the French retired to Natchitoches. That post
was then put under charge of Saint-Denys. Great stress was laid at Paris
upon the necessity for occupying the coast to the west of the mouth of the
Mississippi, and positive orders had been issued to that effect by the King
on the 16th of November, 1718. Nothing was done, however, until 1720,
when six men were landed one hundred and thirty leagues west of the Mississippi
and left to perish. In 1721 these orders were reiterated, and La
Harpe was appointed “commandant and inspector of commerce of the Bay
of St. Bernard.” On August 16 he sailed to take possession of that bay. His
equipment and his force were totally inadequate for the purpose. He made
a landing at some point on the coast; but finding the Indians hostile, he was
obliged to abandon the expedition. With this futile attempt all efforts on the
part of the French to occupy any point on the coast of Texas ceased. On
the other hand, they remained in uninterrupted possession of Natchitoches;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and the Spaniards, though they continued to occupy Adaes as long as the
French were at Natchitoches, never renewed their attempts on the region
of the Osage and the Missouri.</p>

<p>During the year 1721 the mortality of the immigrants on the passage
over seriously affected the growth of the colony. Among other similar
records it is reported that in March two vessels arrived, having on board
forty Germans,&mdash;all that remained out of two hundred. The same month
the “Africaine” landed one hundred and eighty negroes out of two hundred
and eighty on board when she sailed, and the “Duc du Maine” three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hundred and ninety-four out of four hundred and fifty-three. The pains
of the poor creatures did not end with the voyage. Some of them “died
of hunger and suffering on the sands of Fort Louis.” Enfeebled by the
confinement and trials of a protracted ocean voyage, immigrants and slaves
alike were landed on the beach at Biloxi, where neither suitable food nor
proper shelter was furnished them.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Indeed, so great was the distress for
food in 1721, that the very efforts put forth to increase the population were
a source of embarrassment and suffering. There were not provisions
enough left at Biloxi in September to maintain the garrison; and once
again, after more than twenty years’ occupation by the French, the troops
at Biloxi were dispersed among the Indians for subsistence.</p>

<p>The engineers who were watching the action of the Mississippi kept
a record of their soundings. They attributed the changes which they
observed to the scouring action of the water, and suggested methods<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> for
keeping up the strength of the current by restraining the river within
limits. Their observations confirmed Bienville in the opinion that New
Orleans could be reached directly by vessel; thus avoiding the wretched
anchorage, fifteen miles from shore,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and the expensive and troublesome
transfer from ship to barge, and from barge to boat, only to effect a landing
by wading, at a spot which was still several days of difficult travel from the
natural highway of the country.</p>

<p>The news of the collapse of the Royal Bank and of the flight of Law
reached the colony in June, 1721. The expectation that the troubles of the
mother country would react upon the fortunes of the colony created great
excitement; but the immediate result fell short of the anticipation. Affairs
in the territory of Law’s concession were in great confusion. The Alsatians
and Germans whom he had placed upon it, finding themselves neglected
and the future of the grant doubtful, came down to New Orleans in the
expectation of being sent back to Europe. The colony did not willingly
relinquish its hold on any of its settlers. These industrious laborers, who
had been imported to till the soil, were placated by the grant of concessions
along the Mississippi at a point about twenty miles above New Orleans.
By their skill in market-gardening they secured the control of that business
in the little town which almost in spite of the Company had sprung up on
the banks of the river. Bienville, supported by Pauger, one of the engineers,
had for some time favored New Orleans as headquarters. The views
of the Company on this point had fluctuated. In 1718 the instructions
were, to try to open the river to vessels. In 1720 Ship Island, the Alibamons,
and the Ouabache (Ohio) were the points they proposed to fortify.
In 1721 Pauger prepared a plan for the proposed city of New Orleans.
At that time there were only a few cabins there. It was necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
cut down brush and trees to run the lines. Settlers were attracted by
these proceedings, but jealousy stopped the work for a while. Charlevoix,
who visited the place in 1722, says that the transfer of the stores of the
Company from Biloxi to New Orleans began about the middle of June
of that year.</p>

<p>The “Aventurier” arrived in the roadstead in the latter part of May, 1722,
bringing orders to make New Orleans the principal establishment of the
colony. She was taken up the river by the engineers La Tour and Pauger,
and orders were given that all ships should thereafter enter the Mississippi.
The “Aventurier” reached New Orleans July 7, and on the 5th of August
the departure of Bienville from Biloxi for New Orleans is recorded.</p>

<p>Exchange and currency had proved to be serious drawbacks to the
prosperity of Canada. Louisiana was destined to undergo a similar
experience. Paper money and card money were issued by the Company.
Arbitrary ordinances requiring the presentation of these bills for redemption
within a stated time were suddenly promulgated. The price at which
the silver dollar should circulate was raised and lowered by edict. Copper
money was also forced into circulation. The “Aventurier” had some of
this coin on board when she made her famous trip to New Orleans. It was
imported, conformably to the edict of June, 1721. The inhabitants were
enjoined to receive it without demur, as the Company would take it on the
same terms as gold and silver.</p>

<p>To provide for the adjustment of disputes, the colony was divided into
nine districts, and judicial powers were conferred upon the commanders of
the districts. The jurisdiction of the Superior Council was made exclusively
appellate. A similar appellate court, subordinate, however, to the Superior
Council, was provided for Illinois.</p>

<p>By ordinance issued May 16, 1722, by the commissioners of the Council,
with consent of the Bishop of Quebec, the province of Louisiana was
divided into three spiritual jurisdictions. The first comprised the banks
of the Mississippi from the Gulf to the mouth of the Ohio, and included
the region to the west between these latitudes. The Capuchins were to
officiate in the churches and missions of this district, and their Superior was
to reside in New Orleans. The second district comprised all the territory
north of the Ohio, and was assigned to the charge of the Jesuits, whose
headquarters were to be in Illinois. The district south of the Ohio and
east of the Mississippi was assigned to the Carmelites. The residence of
their Superior was ordinarily to be at Mobile. Each of the three Superiors
was to be a grand vicar of the Bishop of Quebec.</p>

<p>By ordinance of the Bishop of Quebec, issued Dec. 19, 1722, the
district of the Carmelites was added to that of the Capuchins. The
Carmelites then returned to France. In the month of December, 1723,
the northern boundary of this district was changed to Natchez, and all
the country north of that point, to the east and to the west, was put under
charge of the Jesuits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 27th of June, 1725, the Company, to allay the fears of the
Capuchins, issued a new ordinance, in which they declared that the Capuchins
alone should have the right to perform ecclesiastical functions in
their district, and that no priest or monk of other brotherhood should
be permitted to do so except with their consent. By request of the
Capuchins, this was confirmed by patent from the King, dated the 25th
of July, 1725.</p>

<p>The Capuchins had neither the numbers nor the influence essential for
so great a work. For this reason the Company assigned the care of the
French posts of the district to the Capuchins, and the charge of the Indian
missions to the Jesuits; and an agreement was made, Feb. 26, 1726,
with the Jesuit fathers, in which the latter undertook to furnish missionaries
for the required work. In consequence of this arrangement it became
necessary for the Jesuits to have an establishment in New Orleans. Permission
to have such establishment was granted by the Company, on
condition that they should exercise no ecclesiastical function except by
consent of the Capuchins. Beaubois, the Jesuit Superior, disregarded this
injunction, and undertook to override the Capuchins, who would have
returned to France if he had not been recalled.</p>

<p>On the 13th of September, 1726, the Company entered into a contract
with the Ursulines, in which the latter agreed to provide six nuns for the
hospital and to educate the girls of New Orleans. The nuns, who were
furnished in pursuance of this agreement, sailed from France Feb. 23, 1727.
After a perilous voyage, five months in length, they arrived at New Orleans
and at once entered on their work.</p>

<p>In 1724 the accumulated complaints of the several officers with whom
Bienville had come into collision produced his downfall. La Harpe came
to his rescue in a memorial upon the importance of the country and the
necessity of maintaining the colony. Louisiana was not to be held responsible
for frauds on the Company, nor for lack of system and bad management
in its affairs. The Company itself had “begun by sending over
convicts, vagrants, and degraded girls. The troops were made up of
deserters and men indiscriminately picked up in the streets of Paris. The
warehouses were openly robbed by clerks, who screened their knaveries
by countless false entries. Disadvantageous bargains were made with
companies of Swiss and Germans, of miners, and manufacturers of tobacco,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
which turned out absolutely without value because the Company did not
carry them out. A vast number of burdensome offices were created. The
greater part of the directors who were sent out thought only of their own
interests and of how they could thwart M. de Bienville, a man more
familiar with the country than they were. If he proposed to bring ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
up the river, they obstinately opposed him, fearing that they would then
no longer be able to maintain traffic with the Spaniards and thus amass
fortunes.” La Harpe’s interposition may have subsequently influenced
opinions as to Bienville’s merits, but at the time it had no apparent result.
In February, 1724, Bienville received positive orders to return to France.
The brief interval which elapsed before he sailed gave him an opportunity
to associate his name with the issue of the harsh and arbitrary code of
fifty-four articles regulating the conduct of the unfortunate slaves in the
colony, and imposing penalties for violations of law.</p>

<p>On his return to France, Bienville presented a memorial in vindication
of his course. Eight years before this he had urged upon the Marine
Council that he was entitled to promotion. The recapitulation of his
services, with which he opened his letter, is used again in substance in the
memorial: “For thirty-four years Sieur de Bienville has had the honor
of serving the King, twenty-seven of them as <i>lieutenant du roy</i> and as
commandant of the colony. In 1692 he was appointed midshipman. He
served seven years as such, and made seven sea-voyages in actual service
on armed vessels of the navy. During these seven years he participated
in all the combats waged by his brother, the late Sieur d’Iberville, upon
the shores of New England, at Newfoundland, and at Hudson’s Bay; and
among others in the action in the North against three English vessels.
These three vessels, one of which had fifty-four guns and each of the others
forty-two, attacked the said Sieur d’Iberville, then commanding a frigate
of forty-two guns. In a combat of five hours he sank the fifty-four-gun
ship, and took one of the others; while the third, disabled, slipped away
under cover of the night. The said Sieur de Bienville was then seriously
wounded in the head.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He then refers to his services in the exploring
expedition and in the colony, closing with the statement that his father
was killed by the savages in Canada, and that seven of his brothers died
in the French naval service.</p>

<p>In support of his memorial, and to refute statements that there would
be an Indian outbreak if he should return, several representatives of the
Indian tribes of the colony, moved thereto by Bienville’s relatives, were
admitted to an audience with the Superior Council, and there pronounced
themselves friendly to him. It was thus that the red men, on whom he
had relied for food at some time in nearly every year since he landed in
Louisiana, rewarded him for his friendly interest in their behalf,&mdash;him
who had been the advocate of the plan for exiling them to Santo Domingo,
there to be exchanged for negroes; who had subdued the eight hundred
warriors of the Natchez by treacherously seizing and holding their principal
chiefs; who, on the 1st of February, 1723, wrote that an important
advantage over the Chickasaws had been gained without the loss of a
French life, “through the care that I took to set these barbarians against
each other.”</p>

<p>All efforts of Bienville for reinstatement were thrown away. The
Council were of opinion that much of the wrangling in the colony was
due to the Le Moynes. M. Périer was appointed governor; and in order
that his administration might have a fair
chance, several of Bienville’s relatives were
deprived of office in the colony. Under the
new Government, events moved on as before.
The quiet of colonial life was undisturbed
except for the wrangling of the officials, the publication of company orders,
and the announcement of royal edicts. In a memorial forwarded by the
commander of Dauphin Island and Biloxi, a highly colored picture is
shown of the chaotic condition of affairs. “The army was without discipline.
Military stores and munitions of war were not protected. Soldiers
deserted at pleasure. Warehouses and store-ships were pillaged. Forgers,
thieves, and murderers went unpunished. In short, the country was a disgrace
to France, being without religion, without justice, without discipline,
without order, and without police.”</p>

<p>Bienville had steered clear of serious Indian complications. He had
settled by deceit, without a blow and almost without troops, what in place
of more stirring events had been called the “first war of the Natchez.” On
the occasion of a second collision, in 1723, he had simply appeared upon
the scene with a superior force, and dictated terms to the natives. During
Périer’s term of office signs of uneasiness among the natives and of impending
trouble began to show themselves. Warnings were given to
several of the inhabitants of Natchez that danger was to be apprehended
from the neighboring tribe. The commander of the post wilfully neglected
these warnings, which were repeatedly brought to his knowledge. On the
29th of November, 1729, the Natchez Indians rose, and slaughtered nearly
all the male inhabitants of the little French village.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The scene was
attended with the usual ingenious horrors of an Indian massacre. A prolonged
debauch succeeded. The Yazoos, a neighboring tribe, surprised
and slaughtered the little garrison which held the post in their country.
Even the fathers in charge of the spiritual affairs of the posts were not
spared.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Except for this uprising of the Yazoos, the example of the
Natchez tribe was not contagious. News was quickly conveyed up and
down the river, and but little damage happened to travellers between
Illinois and Louisiana.</p>

</div></div>

<p>According to Dumont, the Choctaws and Natchez had conspired to
attack the French simultaneously at New Orleans and Natchez, and the
attack at Natchez was made in advance of the day agreed upon for the
outbreak. At this, he says, the Choctaws were exasperated, and announced
that they were willing to move in conjunction with the French upon
Natchez. According to their own professions, however, their friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for the French was uninterrupted, and they denied any previous knowledge
of the outbreak at Natchez. Whatever the motive which prompted
it, a joint military campaign against the Natchez was now organized
with the Choctaws. All the credit in the affair was gained by the Indians.
They were first in the field, and they did all the open fighting.
When the French tardily arrived on the spot, instead of the surprise, the
sudden attack, the rapid flight, and the complete victory or defeat which
had hitherto characterized most Indian warfare, they found the Natchez
behind rude fortifications, within which they had gathered all their people,
together with the women and children captured at the recent attack
on the village. The French were compelled to approach these defences
with all the formalities of a siege. At the end of what Périer bombastically
terms “six days of open trenches and ten days of cannonade,”
the Natchez on the 26th of February, 1730, surrendered the captive
women, children, and slaves to the Choctaws, withdrew their entire force,
and fled to the opposite bank of the Mississippi. The knowledge that
the French captives were with the Indians probably hampered the French
in their attack.</p>

<p>The services of tribes friendly to the French were secured during the
summer to harass the miserable Natchez; and on the 1st of August the
Governor could proudly report that by this means he had been able since
their migration to kill a hundred and fifty. “Lately,” he says in one of his
despatches, “I burned four men and two women here, and the others I sent
to Santo Domingo.” Smarting under the disgrace cast upon their reputation
by the fruitless results of this campaign, the French felt the necessity
for subduing the fugitive Natchez, who still preserved their tribal organization
and their independence. An alleged negro insurrection the next
summer furnished opportunity for hanging “ten or a dozen of the most
culpable” of the negroes, and further demonstrated the necessity for some
attempt to recover the prestige of the French name.</p>

<p>In the month of November, 1730, Périer started on a crusade against
his foes. The force which he ultimately brought together for this expedition
is said to have been a thousand men, of whom seven hundred were
French. In January, 1731,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> he succeeded in running down the Natchez
in their fort, situated a short distance from the river on the west side,
where he besieged and finally captured&mdash;according to his own account&mdash;four
hundred and fifty women and children and forty-five men. Again the
greater part of the warriors of the tribe escaped him. The captives were
sent to Santo Domingo, where they were sold as slaves.</p>

<p>The resources of the colony were now better understood. Buffalo-wool,
pearls, and mines were no longer relied upon. Prosperity had eluded the
grasp of the greater part of the settlers; but if agricultural experiments
had not proved remunerative as they had been handled, they had at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
demonstrated the fertility of the soil. The hopes of commercial success,
with so scant a population and under the restrictions of the monopoly,
were shown to be delusive. The climate had proved a severe trial to the
health of the settlers.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Perhaps the character of the immigrants, their
improvident habits, and their reckless exposure had much to do with it, and
had made the test an unfair one. At all events the experience of the
Company was but a repetition of that of Crozat; and in 1731 the rights
granted in the charter were surrendered to the King. During Périer’s
administration a change was made in the character of the girls sent over
to the colony. In 1728 there arrived a ship bearing a considerable number
of young girls who had not been taken from the houses of correction.
They were cared for by the Ursulines until they were married.</p>

<p>It is not easy to follow the growth of the colony. When Crozat turned
matters over to the Company, there were said to be seven hundred inhabitants;
but four years afterward the Company officials, in one of their reports,
put this number at four hundred. The official estimate in 1721 was five
thousand four hundred and twenty, of whom six hundred were negroes.
La Harpe, in his memorial, puts the population in 1724 at five thousand
whites and three thousand blacks. At the time of the retrocession to the
King the white population was estimated at five thousand, and the negroes
at over two thousand.</p>

<p>The treasury notes of the Company at that time constituted the circulating
medium of the colony. Fifteen days were allowed, during which their
use could be continued. After that their circulation was prohibited, with
appropriate penalties.</p>

<p>The Government signalized its renewal of the direct charge of the colony
by efforts to build up its commerce. Bienville succeeded in securing his
appointment as governor, and in 1733 returned to Louisiana. The finances
of the colony having undergone the disturbance of the withdrawal of the
paper money of the Company, the Government consulted the colonial officers
as to issuing in its place some card money. These gentlemen recommended
that the issue should be postponed for two years. The impatience
of the Government could, however, be restrained but a year, when the entering
wedge of two hundred thousand livres was ordered,&mdash;the beginning of
more inflation. In 1736 Bienville, owing to the unfriendly attitude of the
Chickasaws, felt the necessity of success in some movement against them,
if he would retain the respect and friendship of the Choctaws. He therefore
made an imposing demonstration against the Chickasaw villages.
According to his own account, he had with him over twelve hundred men,
who in an attack on one of the villages were repulsed with such severe loss
that the whole party were glad to get back to the shelter of their permanent
forts, without the satisfaction of knowing that they had either killed
or wounded one of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chickasaws had apparently learned the value of earthworks as defences,
from their experience, if not from the English traders. Some of
these traders were in the village at the time of the attack, and hoisted the
English flag over their cabins. By throwing up the earth around their
houses, the Indians had converted each habitation into a fortification.
Unfortunately for the objects of the expedition, Bienville learned, on his
return to Mobile, that a coöperating column, organized in Illinois, and composed
mainly of Northern Indians, which had marched under young Artaguette
against the same enemy, had been completely worsted, and their
leader was reported killed.</p>

<p>If the movement against the Chickasaws was demanded by the condition
of affairs before this demonstration, the repulse made a renewal of
it at an early day a positive necessity. A strong force of men was sent
over from France under an officer trusted by the Court, and in 1739 an
advance was made with twelve hundred white soldiers and twenty-four hundred
Indians, by way of the Mississippi instead of the Tombigbee. They
were joined at a point near the present site of Memphis by a company
under Céloron, and by a detachment from Fort Chartres under Buissonière.
Five months were consumed in exploring a road which was supposed to
have been already laid out before they started. During this time all the
provisions of the expedition were consumed, and the main army was obliged
to return without having seen the enemy. The extensive preparations for
the expedition had, however, a moral effect. In March a company of
Canadians and Northern Indians, which had reported at the appointed rendezvous,
penetrated alone to the Chickasaw villages. The chiefs of that
tribe, believing that this corps was supported by the expedition, sued for
peace, which the French gladly granted them.</p>

<p>Every military effort put forth by Bienville since his return to Louisiana
had resulted disastrously. The old story of accusation and counter-accusation
between the resident officials of the colony continued during his
second term as before. Chagrined at his lack of success, and mortified by
evident distrust of his abilities shown by the Court, he tendered his resignation
and pathetically wrote: “If success proportionate to my application
to the business of the Government and to my zeal in the service of the King
had always responded to my efforts, I should gladly have consecrated the
rest of my days to this work; but a sort of fatality has pursued me for some
time, has thwarted the greater part of my best-laid plans, has often made
me lose the fruit of my labors, and perhaps, also, a part of the confidence
of Your Highness.” On the 10th of May, 1743, he was relieved by the
Marquis de Vaudreuil, and he then returned to France. He was at that
time sixty-two years of age, and never revisited the scene of nearly forty-four
years of active life in the service of the Government. He was called
the “Father of the Colony,” and a certain romantic affection attaches to
his memory, based rather upon his professed good-will than upon any
success shown in his management of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>During the remainder of the life of the colony, under the administration
of M. de Vaudreuil until he was called to Canada, and after that under
M. de Kerlerec, his successor, there was no material change in the condition
of affairs. All attempts at recapitulation of events resolve themselves into
dreary reiterations of what has already been told again and again. Tobacco
and rice continued to be the staple products of the colony. Hopes were
still maintained that something might be made by cultivating the indigo-plant.
The sugar-cane was introduced in 1751.</p>

<p>There was more of tampering with the currency. Incredible as it may
seem, there was scarcity of provisions at this late day, and appeals to France
for food.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The friendly Choctaws were again incited to war against their
traditional enemies, the Chickasaws, and strife was also stirred up among
themselves. Another warlike expedition boldly marched to the Chickasaw
villages and came back again. Criminations and recriminations between
governor and <i>commissaire-ordonnateur</i> continued to the end, with few
intermissions and with as lively a spirit as characterized the fiercest days of
Bienville’s chronic fights. There was another shipment of girls as late as
1751. The character of the troops remained as before, and deserters continued
to be a source of annoyance. Even the children of the colonists
were affected by their surroundings, if we may believe an anonymous
writer,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> who says, “a child of six years of age knows more of raking and
swearing than a young man of twenty-five in France.”</p>

<p>Illinois, separated from the cabals of the little courts at Quebec and New
Orleans, showed some signs of prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In 1711 Father Marest wrote:
“There was no village, no bridge, no ferry, no boat, no house, no beaten path;
we travelled over prairies intersected by rivulets and rivers, through forests
and thickets filled with briers and thorns, through marshes where we
plunged up to the girdle.” The character of the returns expected by the
French from this country had been shown by the expeditions of Le Sueur
and La Mothe Cadillac. A few boat-loads of green earth had been sent to
France by Le Sueur for assay, but no mines were opened. La Mothe brought
down a few specimens of silver ore which had been found in Mexico,
and some samples of lead from the mines which were shown him fourteen
miles west of the river; but he discovered no silver mines. Nevertheless,
the Company had great faith in this region. Their estimate of the dangers
to which it was exposed may be gathered from the instructions to Ordonnateur
Duvergier in the fall of 1720. He was told where the principal fortifications
were to be maintained. Illinois, the directors said, being so far
inland, would require a much smaller fort. Communication was to be
opened up with that post by land. Positive commands were given to hold
a post on the Ohio River, in order to occupy the territory in advance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the English, and prevent them from getting a foothold there. “Illinois is
full of silver, copper, and lead mines, which ought to produce considerable
returns if worked. The Company has sent to the colony a number of
miners to open the mines and to begin work there as an example to the
owners of concessions and to the inhabitants. The troop of Sieur Renault,
composed of people accustomed to work of this sort, went to the colony
at the same time; but the two troops, according to last reports, are not yet
at Illinois.”</p>

<p>About the same time it was ordered that “the establishment made by
Boisbriant,” originally a few leagues below the village of the Kaskaskias,
but apparently afterward transferred to a point about the same distance
above the village, should be “called Fort de Chartres.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In 1721 Charlevoix traversed this region. Speaking of the so-called fort
at St. Joseph, near the foot of Lake Michigan, he says: “The commandant’s
house, which is but a sorry one, is called a fort from its being surrounded
with an indifferent palisade,&mdash;which is pretty near the case with all the
rest.” The route of Charlevoix was up the St. Joseph across a portage to
the Kankakee, and down that river, the Illinois, and the Mississippi, to Fort
Chartres, the next French station which he mentions.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> He describes it as
standing about a musket-shot from the river. He heard of mines both
copper and lead. Renault, or Renaud, as he is generally called, who was
working the lead mines, still hoped for silver. Even after this we hear
occasionally of alleged mineral discoveries and revived hopes of mines;
but neither the Company nor the Government were destined to reap any
great revenue from this source.</p>

<p>The duties of Boisbriant and of his successors were almost exclusively
limited to adjudicating quarrels, administering estates, watching Indians,
and granting provisional titles to lands or setting off rights in the common
fields of the villages. The history of these years is preserved in fragments
of church-registers, in mouldy grants of real estate, or in occasional certificates
of marriage which have by chance been saved. No break occurred in
this monotony till the joint movement against the Chickasaws, of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Artaguette from Fort Chartres and of Vinsennes from his post on the
Wabash in 1736. The troops from these posts, who were to move from
the North at the same time that Bienville should approach from the South,
following their orders, met and advanced at the appointed time. Their
prompt obedience brought them to the spot in advance of the dilatory
Bienville, and enabled the Chickasaws, as has been previously stated, to
meet the columns separately and defeat them in detail. A column from
this fort was also in the body of troops from the North which co-operated
in the second attack on these Indians.</p>

<p>During this uneventful time the little colony grew, and the settlers
enjoyed a moderate degree of prosperity. A contented population of
about two thousand whites,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> to whom grants of land had been freely made
for purposes of settlement or cultivation, was mainly engaged in agricultural
pursuits. Side by side with them the natives were gathered in villages
in which were established Jesuit missions. The fertile soil readily yielded
to their efforts at cultivation more than they could consume, and each year
the surplus products were floated down to New Orleans. Bossu asserted
that all the flour for the lower country came from Illinois. Vaudreuil,
before leaving the colony for Canada, reported<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that boats came down the
river annually with provisions; but as late as 1744 he still harped on the
discovery of new copper and lead mines. Of the real agricultural value
of the country there could not at that time have been any just appreciation.
As a mining region it had proved to be a failure.</p>

<p>The little fort needed
repairs;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and La Galissonière, with his usual sagacity, wrote, “The little
colony of Illinois ought not to be left to perish. The King must sacrifice
for its support. The principal advantage of the country is its extreme productiveness;
and its connection with Canada and Louisiana must be maintained.”
Apparently the urgency of La Galissonière produced some results.
Macarty, the officer who had command of the post at the time of the collision
between the French and the English at the headwaters of the Ohio,
arrived at Fort Chartres in the winter of 1751-1752. Bossu, who accompanied
him, writes from the fort: “The Sieur Saussier, an engineer, has
made a plan for constructing a new fort here, according to the intention
of the Court. It will bear the same name with the old one, which is called
Fort de Chartres.” In January, 1755, Bossu arrived a second time at the
post, having in the mean time made a trip to New Orleans. He says: “I
came once more to the old Fort Chartres, where I lay in a hut till I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
get a lodging in the new fort, which is almost finished. It is built of freestone,
flanked with four bastions, and capable of containing a garrison of
three hundred<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> men.” The construction of this fort was the final effort
of France in the Valley of the Mississippi. It proved to be of even less
value than the fortress at Louisbourg, upon which so much money was
wasted, for it fell into the hands of the enemy without the formality of a
siege. On the other side of the river, Bournion, who in 1721 bore the
title of “Commandant du Missouri,” founded Fort Orleans on an island in
the Missouri, and left a garrison<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> there, which was afterward massacred.
Misère, now known as St. Genevieve, was founded about 1740.</p>

<p>As events drifted on toward the end of the French occupation, the difficulties
of the French Government elsewhere compelled the absolute neglect
of Louisiana. Kerlerec writes in 1757 that he has not heard from the
Court for two years; and in 1761 the French ambassador, in a memorial to
the Court at Madrid, states that for four years no assistance had been furnished
to the colony. An estimate of the population made in 1745 places
the number of inhabitants at six thousand and twenty, of whom four thousand
were white. Compared with the number at the time of the retrocession
by the Company, it shows a falling off of a thousand whites. It is
probable that the white population was even less at a later day. It is not
strange that the feeble results of this long occupation should have led the
Most Christian King to the determination to present the colony to his very
dear and much-loved cousin, the King of Spain,&mdash;an act which was consummated
in 1762, but not made public at the time. Its influence was
not felt until later.</p>

<p class="p2">The outline of events in Canada which we have previously traced carried
us to a point where the first collision in the Valley of the Ohio between the
troops of the two great nations who were contending for the mastery of
the northern portion of the continent had already taken place. News of
this contest reached New Orleans, and reports of what was occurring at the
North served to fill out the Louisiana despatches. From this source we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
learn that the Chevalier de Villiers,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> a captain stationed at Fort Chartres,
solicited the privilege of leading an expedition to avenge the death of his
brother Jumonville, who had been killed by the Virginian force under
Washington. The request was granted; and thus the troops from the East
and from the West participated in these preliminary contests in the Valley
of the Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>It is not within the proposed limits of this sketch to follow in detail the
military events with which each of the few remaining years of French
domination in America were marked. The death-struggle was protracted
much longer than could have been anticipated. The white population of
the English colonies is said to have been over ten times greater than that
of Canada in 1755; and yet these odds did not fairly express the difference
between the contending Powers.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The disproportion of the aid which might
be expected from the mother countries was far greater. The situation was
the reverse of what it had been in the past. England began to show some
interest in her colonies. She was prosperous, and the ocean was open to
her cruisers. The French experiments at colonization in America had
proved a source of expense so great as to check the sympathy and crush
the hopes of the Court. The vessels of France could only communicate
with her colonies by eluding the search of the English ships widely scattered
over the sea. Although no formal declaration of war was made until
1756, England did not hesitate to seize French merchant-vessels and to
attack French men-of-war, and she backed the pretensions of her colonists
with solid arguments clad in red coats and bearing glittering bayonets.
France shipped a few soldiers and some stores to Canada. Some of her
vessels succeeded in running the gauntlet of the English cruisers, but more
were driven ashore or captured. The native Canadians, more French than
Frenchmen themselves, rallied to the support of the Government which had
strangled every sign of independent life in their country. Old men and
children joined the ranks to repel the invader; and again we have the story
repeated of scant crops improperly harvested because of lack of field
hands, and thereafter actual suffering for food in this old and well-established
colony. The experiences of Braddock and of Dieskau were needed
to teach Europeans the value of the opinions of provincial officers in
matters of border warfare. Temporary successes during several years
inspired hopes in the minds of the French and thwarted the progress of the
English. Nevertheless, the strength of the English began to tell, especially
along the seaboard, where their supremacy was more conspicuous. The
line of French forts across the neck of the Acadian peninsula fell without
serious opposition, and it was determined to remove from the country a
population which would neither take the oath of allegiance to His Britannic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Majesty, nor preserve neutrality in time of war. Their forcible deportation
followed; and in their wanderings some of these “neutral French” even
penetrated to the distant colony of Louisiana, where they settled on the
banks of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Such was the demoralization of the official
class of peculators in Canada that those refugees who escaped to the protection
of its Government were fed with unwholesome food, for which the
King had been charged exorbitant prices by his commissaries. The destruction
of the fort at Oswego postponed for that year the efforts of the
English to interrupt the communication between the valleys of the Ohio
and the St. Lawrence. The destruction of Fort William Henry temporarily
protected Montreal; the check sustained by Abercromby was of equal
military value. But in 1758 Louisbourg, with its garrison and stores
was lost, the little settlements in Gaspé were ravaged, and France was
deprived of the last foot of territory on the North Atlantic seaboard.
Quebec thus became accessible to the enemy by way of the sea without
hindrance.</p>

<p>Distrust and jealousy pervaded the Government councils in Canada.
Pierre François, Marquis of Vaudreuil, the successor of Duquesne in 1755,
and Montcalm, whose cordial
co-operation was essential,
were at swords’ points.
With each succeeding year
the corrupt practices of Intendant
Bigot were more
openly carried on. With famine stalking through the streets of Montreal
and Quebec, with the whole population living on short rations, and bread-stuffs
at incredible prices, the opportunity for this wide-awake Intendant
to make money was never better. If accounts are to be trusted, he availed
himself of his chance; and out of the sufferings and dire necessities of this
sorely pressed people he amassed a fortune.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> All this was to the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of England. Every point that she gained in the struggle she kept.
From each reverse that she sustained she staggered up, surprised that the
little band of half-starved Canadian troops should have prevailed again,
but with renewed determination to conquer. The only value of success
to Canada was to postpone the invasion, and for the time being to keep the
several columns which threatened Montreal from co-operation. With so
feeble a force the French could not hope to maintain the widely scattered
forts which they held at the beginning of hostilities. In 1759 they were
threatened by hostile columns counting more than the entire number of
Canadians capable of bearing arms. All hope of aid from France was
crushed by the Minister, who wrote: “In addition to the fact that reinforcements
would add to the suffering for food which you already experience,
it is very much to be feared that they would be intercepted by the English
on passage.” Such was the mournful condition of affairs when Wolfe sailed
up the St. Lawrence, expecting to find Quebec ready to fall into his hands.
To his surprise, the place was held by a force thoroughly capable of defending
it against the combined strength of his soldiers and sailors. Fortune
favored him, and Quebec was gained.</p>

<p>The resistance of the French during one more campaign was probably
justifiable, but was a mere matter of form. Without hope of assistance
from France, without means of open communication with any other French
possession, without supplies of ammunition or of food, there was really
nothing left to fight for. Even the surrounding parishes of Canada had
yielded to the pressure of events, after the failure to recapture Quebec.
When, therefore, the English columns converged upon Montreal in 1760,
the place capitulated, and the French flag disappeared from Canada.</p>

<p class="p2">At the mouth of the Mississippi French occupation was not disturbed
until the boundaries were adjusted in accordance with the terms of the
Treaty of Peace signed at Paris in February, 1763. No reference was made
in the treaty nor in the preliminary convention to the fact that France had
already granted to Spain her title to the whole of Louisiana. Knowledge
of this remarkable act was kept secret for a few years longer. England,
by the terms of the treaty of Paris, became the acknowledged mistress of
all that portion of the American continent which lies east of the middle
of the Mississippi River, with the exception of the island on which was built
the city of New Orleans. Ample provision was made to protect the rights
of French citizens who might wish to remove from the country. The
privilege of religious worship according to the forms of the Roman Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Church was guaranteed to those who should remain, as far as the laws of
England would permit.</p>

<p class="p2">The era of colonial history which this chapter covers is coincident with
a period of decline in France. The transmission of the throne in the line
of descent was not, however, interfered with, nor were the traditions of
colonial policy changed. The causes of the rise and fall of the colonies
of European Powers at that time are to be found in the history of European
politics; and European politics in turn were largely influenced by the
desire to control territory in the New World. The life of French colonies
was in close contact with European events. If the pulse of the English
settlements did not throb in such sympathy with the mother country, it was
because there was a fundamental difference in the methods by which English
colonies had been formed and in the conditions of their growth. A
colony was not looked upon at that time as forming a part of the parent
State. It was a business venture, entered into directly by the State itself,
or vicariously by means of a grant to some individual or company. If the
colony did not earn money, it was a failure. Spain had derived wealth
from ventures of this sort. Other nations were tempted into the pursuit
of the same policy in the hope of the same result.</p>

<p>To preserve the proper relations to the parent State, the colony should
have within itself elements of wealth which should enrich its projectors;
it should absorb the productions of the State which founded it; and in no
event ought it to come into competition with its progenitor. The form
of the French government was so logical that its colonies could be but
mimic representations of France. Priests and nuns, soldiers and peasants,
nobles and seigniors, responded to the royal order, and moved at the royal
dictation in the miniature Court at Quebec much the same as at Paris.
There was so little elasticity in French life that the French peasant, when
relieved from the cramp of his surroundings, still retained the marks of
pressure. Without ambition and without hope, he did not voluntarily break
away from his native village. If transported across the water, he was still
the French peasant, cheerful in spirit, easily satisfied, content with but
little, and not disposed to wrestle for his rights. The priest wore his shovel-hat
through the dense thickets of the Canadian forests, and clung to his
flowing black robe even though torn to a fringe by the brambles through
which it was trailed. Governor and council, soldier, priest, and peasant,
all bore upon their persons the marks that they were Frenchmen whose
utmost effort was to reproduce in the wilds of America the artificial condition
of society which had found its perfect expression in Versailles.
Autocratic as was Frontenac, unlikely as he was to do anything which
should foster popular notions of liberty, or in any way endanger monarchical
institutions,&mdash;even he drew down upon himself a rebuke from
the Court for giving too much heed to the people in his scheme of
reorganization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>From his palace in France the Grand Monarque dictated the size and
shape of a Canadian farm. He prescribed the localities which new-comers
ought to select. They must not stray too far from villages; they must
clear lands in spots contiguous to settlements. He could find men who
would go to Canada, but there was no emigration of families. Soldiers
in the colony were offered their discharge and a year’s pay if they would
marry and settle. Premiums were offered the colonists for marrying, and
premiums for children. “The new settler,” says Parkman, “was found by
the King, sent over by the King, and supplied by the King with a wife,
a farm, and sometimes with a house.” Popular meetings were in such
disfavor that not until 1717 were the merchants permitted to establish an
exchange at Quebec. His Majesty, while pulling the wires which moved
the puppets of European politics, still found time to express his regrets
that the “King’s officers had been obliged to come down from Frontenac
to Quebec to obtain absolution,” and to convey his instructions to the
Bishop of Quebec to suppress several fête-days which interfered with
agricultural labors. Cared for thus tenderly, it would seem that Canada
should have thriven. Had the measures put forth been wisely directed
toward the prosperity of the colony, it might have done so; but Louis
XIV. was not working for the benefit of Canada; his efforts were exclusively
in behalf of France. In 1706 his Minister wrote: “It is not for the
interest of the parent State that manufactures should be carried on in
America, as it would diminish the consumption of those in France; but
in the mean time the poor are not prohibited from manufacturing stuffs in
their own houses for the relief of themselves and their families.” Generous
monarch! The use of the spinning-wheel and the loom was not forbidden
in the log-cabins in Canada, even if this did clash somewhat with
French trade. “From this permission,” says Heriot, “the inhabitants
have ever since continued to fabricate coarse linen and druggets, which
has enabled them to subsist at a very small expense.” Coin was almost
unknown much of the time; and the paper money and bills of exchange,
upon which the colony depended for a circulating medium, were often
seriously depreciated.</p>

<p>The spirit of organization and inquisition which infested the Government
pervaded all things temporal and spiritual. Trade in peltries could only be
carried on by those having permits from the Government or from the firm
or company which for the time being had the monopoly. All trade at outlying
posts was farmed out by the governors. Young men could not stray
off into the woods without violating a royal edict. Such solicitude could
only produce two results,&mdash;those who endured it became automatons;
those who followed their inclinations and broke away from it were proscribed
as bushrangers. From the day when Champlain founded the city
of Quebec down to the time when the heroic Montcalm received his
death-wound on the Plains of Abraham, the motives which had influenced
the French in their schemes of colonization had been uniform and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
their methods identical. Time enough had elapsed to measure the success
of their efforts.</p>

<p>French colonization in America had reached three degrees of prosperity.
In Acadia, under English rule, freed from military service in the ranks of
the country to which they naturally owed allegiance, and with their rights
as neutrals recognized by the English, the French colonists had prospered
and multiplied. Originally a band of hunters and fishers, they had
gradually become an agricultural population, and had conquered prosperity
out of a soil which did not respond except to the hand of patience and
industry. Exempt from the careful coddling of His Most Christian Majesty,
they had evoked for themselves a government patriarchal in its simplicity
and complete for their needs. In Louisiana, under the hothouse system
of commercial companies and forced immigration, the failure had been
so complete that even those who participated in it could see the cause.
In Canada there was neither the peaceful prosperity of Acadia nor the
melancholy failure of Louisiana. Measured by its own records, the colony
shows steady growth. Compared with its rivals, its laggard steps excite
surprise and demand explanation. The Acadians were French and Catholics.
Neither their nationality nor their religion interfered with their
prosperity. They had, however, been lucky enough to escape from the
friendly care of the French Government. It is but a fair inference that
the Canadians also would have thriven if they could have had a trial
by themselves.</p>

<p class="p2">The history of England during the corresponding period showed no
such uniform motive, no such continuous purpose as to her colonies. From
the time of their foundation the English colonies became practically independent
States, with which the Home Government, during the long period of
political disturbances which intervened, seldom interfered. The transmission
of the crown by descent was interrupted. A parliament displaced
and executed a king. A protector temporarily absorbed his power. The
regular order of the descent of the crown in the restored royal family was
again interrupted. The crowned ruler of England was a fugitive on the
Continent, and Parliament by act prescribed who should govern England,
and afterward how the crown should be transmitted. The causes that produced
English emigration, whether political or religious, varied with these
events, and emigration was correspondingly affected; but whatever the
extent and whatever the character of this influence, the emigration from
England was, as a rule, a voluntary emigration of families. Young men
might be tempted by the fascinating freedom of a wild life in the woods;
but the typical emigrant was the father of a family. He abandoned a
home in the old country. He took with him his wife, his family, and
his household goods. Much of the furniture brought over by the sturdy
emigrants of that time is still treasured by their descendants. The strong
mental individuality which thus led men with families to cut adrift from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the struggles and trials in England, only to encounter the dangers and
difficulties of pioneer life in a new country, found expression in various
ways in the affairs of the colonies, oftentimes to the vexation of the
authorities.</p>

<p>The New France was a reproduction of the Old France, with all, and
more than all, the restrictions which hampered the growth and hindered the
prosperity of the parent State. The New England had inherited all the
elements of prosperity with which the Old England was blessed, and had
even more of that individuality and freedom of action on the part of its
citizens which seems to form so important an element of success. Out
of the heterogeneous mixture of proprietary grants, colonial charters, and
commissions, some of which were granted to bodies which sought exclusive
privileges, while others were based upon broad, comprehensive, and liberal
views; out of the conflicting interests and divergent opinions of fugitive
Congregationalists, Quakers, and Catholics; out of a scattered, unorganized
emigration of men entertaining widely different views upon politics and
religion,&mdash;these aggressive, self-asserting colonists evolved the principle of
the right of the inhabitants to a voice in the affairs of their government; and
whether provision was made for it in the charter or not, houses of burgesses,
general courts, and assemblies were summoned to make laws for the various
colonies. Charters were afterward annulled; laws which contained offensive
assertions of rights were refused the royal assent: but the great fundamental
truth remained,&mdash;that the colonies were self-supporting. They had
proved their capacity, and they constantly showed their determination, to
govern themselves. Each movement of the emigrant away from the coast
became a permanent settlement which required organization and control.
Out of the unforeseen and unexpected conditions which were constantly
occurring came the necessity for local government, to be administered by
officers chosen by the little settlements.</p>

<p>Emerson, in speaking of the first tax assessed upon themselves by the
people of Concord in Massachusetts, accounts for the peculiar developments
of colonial life in New England in the following words: “The greater speed
and success that distinguishes the planting of the human race in this country
over all other plantations in history owe themselves mainly to the new
subdivisions of the State into small corporations of land and power. It is
vain to look for the inventor; no man made them. Each of the parts of
that perfect structure grew out of the necessities of an instant occasion;
the germ was formed in England.”</p>

<p>The pioneer penetrated the forest; he took with him the school-house
and the church. Out of the necessities of instant occasions grew, in New
England at least, the town-meeting,&mdash;the complete expression of a government
whose foundations are laid in the people.</p>

<p>Before leaving the colony, in 1754, the Marquis Duquesne summoned
the Iroquois to a council. In the course of an address which he then
delivered he said: “Are you ignorant of the difference between the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of England and the King of France? Go, see the forts that our King has
established, and you will see that you can still hunt under their very walls.
They have been placed for your advantage in places which you frequent.
The English, on the contrary, are no sooner in possession of a place than
the game is driven away. The forest falls before them as they advance,
and the soil is laid bare so that you can scarce find the wherewithal to
erect a shelter for the night.” No more powerful contrast of the results in
North America of the two methods of colonization could be drawn than
is presented in the words of the French Governor.</p>

<p>In 1831 the <i>Journal historique de l’établissement des Français à la Louisiane</i> was
published at New Orleans and at Paris. It consists of an anonymous historical narrative,
to which is appended a memorial signed by Benard de La Harpe. It is generally quoted
as “La Harpe.” The narrative is founded largely upon the journals of Le Sueur and La
Harpe, though it is evident that the author had other sources of information. Within its

<p>Judge François-Xavier Martin, in the <i>History of Louisiana from the Earliest Period</i>,
2 vols. (New Orleans, 1827-1829), followed closely the authorities accessible to him when
he wrote; his work is a complete, and in the main accurate, compendium of the materials
at his command. A new edition was published at New Orleans in 1882, entitled: <i>The
History of Louisiana from the Earliest Period. With a Memoir of the Author by W. W.
Howe. To which is appended, Annals of Louisiana from 1815 to 1861, by J. F. Condon</i>.</p>

<p>Charles Gayarré is the author of two distinct works which must not be confounded.
<i>Louisiana, its Colonial History and Romance</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> is a history of colonial romance rather than
a history of the colony. The <i>Histoire de la Louisiane</i><a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> is an essentially different book.
It is mainly composed of transcripts from original documents, woven together with a
slender thread of narrative. He states in his Preface that he has sought to remove from
sight his identity as a writer, and to let the contemporaries tell the story themselves.
References to Gayarré in this chapter are exclusively made to the <i>Histoire</i>, which was
brought down to 1770. His final work (reprinted in 1885) was in English, and was continued
to 1861.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> In this edition two volumes are given to the French domination, one to

<p>Dumont, whose <i>Mémoires historiques sur la Louisiane</i><a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> were edited by M. L. Le M.
(said to have been L’Abbé Le Mascrier), was in the military service in the colony. In
the <i>Journal historique</i>, etc., mention is made of a sub-lieutenant Dumont de Montigny<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
at the post at Yazoo. The author was stationed at this post, and accompanied La
Harpe up the Arkansas. The statement made in biographical works that Butel Dumont,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
who was born in 1725, was the author, is manifestly incorrect. Both Dumont and Le
Page were contributors to the <i>Journal œconomique</i>, a Paris periodical of the day. We
are able positively to identify him as Dumont de Montigny, through an article on the
manner in which the Indians of Louisiana dress and tan skins, in that journal, August,
1752. Dumont had a correspondence with Buache the cartographer<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> on the subject of
the great controversy of the day,&mdash;the sea of the west and the northwest passage. Dumont
was fond of a good-sounding story;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and his book, like that of Le Page depends
for its value largely upon the interest of his personal experiences. Another book of the
same class is the <i>Nouveaux voyages aux Indes occidentales</i>,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> by M. Bossu. The author,
an army officer, was first sent up the Tombigbee, and afterward attached to the forces
which were posted in Illinois, and was there when Villiers marched on Fort Necessity.
He was in the colony twelve years, and bore a good reputation.</p>

<p>The work entitled <i>État présent de la Louisiane, avec toutes les particularités de cette
province d’Amérique</i>, par le Colonel Chevalier de Champigny (A la Haye, 1776), has been
generally quoted as if Champigny were the author. In an editorial introduction Champigny
says the text and the notes were furnished him in manuscript by an English officer.
In the body of the work the statement is made by the author that he accompanied the English
forces which took possession of the colony after its cession to England. This work is
cited by Mr. Adams in the boundary discussion.</p>

<p>The <i>Mémoire historique et politique de la Louisiane</i>, by M. de Vergennes, minister
of Louis XVI. (Paris, 1802), contains a brief historical sketch of the colony, intended only

<p>A number of the relations in the <i>Lettres édifiantes et curieuses</i> cover portions of
the period and territory of this chapter. These have been collected and translated by
Bishop Kip in the <i>Early Jesuit Missions</i> (Albany, 1866). To avoid repetition, he has
made certain abridgments. Some of the material thus left out has value to the student
of the early history of Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Major Amos Stoddard, in his <i>Sketches Historical and Descriptive of Louisiana</i>
(Philadelphia, 1812), furnished an unostentatious and modest book, which has been
freely quoted.</p>

<p>The <i>Relation du voyage des dames religieuses Ursulines de Rouen</i>, etc. (Paris, 1872),
with an introduction and notes by Gabriel Gravier, is an exact reprint of a publication
at Rouen in 1728 of certain letters of Marie Madeleine Hachard, sœur Saint-Stanislas,
to her father. The account of the tedious journey of the nuns from Paris to Orient,
and of their perilous voyage to New Orleans, was worth preservation. M. Gravier has
performed his part of the work with the evident satisfaction which such a task would
afford a bibliophile and an antiquary. His introductory chapter contains a condensed history
of Louisiana down to 1727, and is strongly fortified with quotations. He acknowledges
himself to be indebted to M. Boimare for a great number of valuable unpublished
documents relating to the foundation of New Orleans. Greater familiarity with his subject
would have enabled him to escape several errors of date and of statement into which
he has been led by authorities whose carelessness he apparently did not suspect. The
memorial concerning the Church in Louisiana (<i>note</i> 1, p. 113 <i>et seq.</i>) is a document
of great value and interest. M. Gravier (p. lvi) states that the Relation is substantially
the same as the <i>Relation du voyage des fondatrices de la Nouvelle Orléans, écrite
aux Ursulines de France, par la première supérieure, la mère St. Augustin</i>, which was
reprinted by Dr. Shea in an edition of one hundred copies in 1859, under the general title
of <i>Relation du voyage des premières Ursulines à la Nouvelle Orléans et de leur établissement
en cette ville [1727], par la Rev. Mère St. A. de Tranchepain; avec les lettres
circulaires de quelquesunes de ses sœurs, et de la dite mère</i> (62 pp.).</p>

<p>The <i>History of the American Indians, particularly those Nations adjoining to the
Mississippi, East and West Florida, Georgia, South and North Carolina, and Virginia</i>,
etc., by James Adair, who was forty years in the country, is a work of great value,
showing the relations of the English traders to the Indians, and is of much importance
to the student of Indian customs.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Géologie pratique de la Louisiane</i>, by R. Thomassy (New Orleans and Paris,
1860), contains copies of some rare documents which were first made public in this
volume.</p>

<p>The <i>Histoire de la Louisiane</i><a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> by M. Barbé Marbois is so brief in its treatment of
the period covered by this chapter that very little can be gained from consulting that
portion of the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>A work entitled <i>De la puissance Américaine</i>, by M. Guillaume-Tell Poussin, was
published at Paris in 1843. A translation was printed at Philadelphia in 1851. The
writer, from his familiarity with this country, was especially fitted to give a French view of
our history. His chapter on Louisiana shows that he had access to the treasures of the
Paris Archives. Its value, however, is diminished by the fact that he is inexact in his
details.</p>

<p>Daniel Coxe, the son of Dr. Coxe, the claimant of the Carolana grant, published in
London in 1722 <i>A Description of the English Province of Carolana, by the Spaniards
call’d Florida, and by the French La Louisiane</i>.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The body of the text is devoted to
a description of the attractions of the province to the emigrant. The preface contains an
account of the entrance of the Mississippi by the vessel which was turned back by
Bienville. The appendix is an argument in favor of the claimant’s title to the grant, and
of England’s title to the Mississippi Valley. It contains a curious story of a Massachusetts
expedition to New Mexico in 1678, and a claim that La Salle’s guides were
Indians who accompanied that expedition.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The official correspondence concerning the Louisiana boundary question may be found
in Waite’s <i>American State Papers and Public Documents</i> (Boston, 1815-1819), vol. xii.
The temperate statements of Don Pedro Cevallos are in strong contrast with the extravagant
assumptions of Luis de Orris, who even cites as authority the mythical Admiral
Fonte.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Yoakum, in his <i>History of Texas</i> (New York, 1856), goes over this ground, and
publishes in his appendix an interesting document from the archives of Bexar.</p>

<p><i>Illinois in the Eighteenth Century</i>, by Edward G. Mason (Fergus Historical Series,
no. 12), Chicago, 1881, has two papers dealing with the topics of this chapter: “Kaskaskia
and its parish records” and “Old Fort Chartres.” The recital of the grants, the marriages,
and the christenings at Kaskaskia and St. Anne brings us close to Boisbriant,
Artaguette, and the other French leaders whose lives are interwoven with the narrative
of events in Illinois. The description of Fort Chartres is by far the best extant. The
work of rescuing from oblivion this obscure phase of Illinois history has been faithfully
performed.</p>

<p>The following works have been freely used by writers upon the early history of Illinois
and the Illinois villages and forts:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Administration of the Colonies</i>, by Thomas Pownall, 2d ed. (London, 1765).
The appendix, section 1, deals with the subject of this chapter.</p>

<p><i>A Topographical Description of North America</i>, by T. Pownall (London, 1776).
Appendix, no. 4, p. 4, Captain Harry Gordon’s Journal, describes the fort and villages.</p>

<p>Thomas Hutchins has also published two books,&mdash;<i>An Historical Narrative and
Topographical Description of Louisiana</i>, etc. (Philadelphia, 1784), and <i>A Topographical
Description</i>, etc. (London, 1778).</p>

<p>Captain Philip Pittman prepared a report on <i>The Present State of the European
Settlements on the Mississippi</i>. It was published in London, in 1770. It is embellished
with charts of the river and plans of several of the forts and villages.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

Stuvé’s <i>Complete History of Illinois</i> (Springfield, 1874). <i>The History of the Discovery

<p><i>Mississippi as a Province, Territory, and State</i>, by J. F. H. Claiborne (1880), devotes
considerable space to the Province.</p>

<p>Extracts from a memoir by M. Marigny de Mandeville may be found in several of the
histories of Louisiana of colonial times. In a note in Bossu<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> it is stated that such a
work was published in Paris in 1765.</p>

<p>The story of Saint-Denys’ experiences in Mexico is told in H. H. Bancroft’s <i>North
Mexican States</i>, p. 612 <i>et seq.</i>, in which the sources of information are mainly Mexican
and Spanish. The hero of Penicaut’s romances, viewed from this standpoint, becomes a
mere smuggler.</p>

<p>Under the title <i>Historical Collections of Louisiana</i>, etc., Mr. B. F. French, in the
years 1846-1875, inclusive, published seven volumes containing reprints and translations
of original documents and rare books. Mr. French was a pioneer in a class of work
the value of which has come to be fully appreciated. His <i>Collections</i> close a gap on the
shelves of many libraries which it would be difficult otherwise to fill. The work was
necessarily an education to him, and in some instances new material which came to his
hands revealed errors in previous annotations.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The value of the work would have been

<p>The fourth and fifth volumes<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of Pierre Margry’s <i>Découvertes et établissements des
Français dans l’ouest et dans le sud de l’Amérique septentrionale</i> contain the material
upon which so much of this chapter as relates to Iberville’s expeditions is founded. We
have here Iberville’s correspondence with the minister, his memorials, the instructions given
to him, and his reports.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> There are also some of Bienville’s despatches, and the correspondence
with the engineer about New Orleans and about the bar at the mouth of the river.
The publication of these volumes has enabled us to correct several minor errors which
have been transmitted from the earlier chroniclers. Interesting as the volumes are,
and close as their scrutiny brings us to the daily life of the celebrated explorer, it is not
easy to understand why their contents should have been shrouded with such a profound
mystery prior to their publication.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The periodicals and tracts of the eighteenth century contain many historical articles

The manuscripts in the Archives at Paris have by no means been exhausted. Harrisse, in
his <i>Notes pour servir à l’histoire, etc., de la Nouvelle France</i> (Paris, 1872), gives an account
of the vicissitudes which they have undergone. He traces the history of the formation
of the Archives of the Marine and of the Colonies and points out the protecting and
organizing care, which Colbert during his ministry devoted through intelligent deputies to
the arranging of those documentary sources, among which the modern historian finds all
that the Revolution of 1789 has left to him.</p>

<p>The copies which from time to time have been procured from France for the State
Archives of Louisiana have so generally disappeared, particularly during the Federal
occupation, that but a small portion of them still remains in the State Library.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><b>I.</b> <span class="smcap">Law and the Mississippi Bubble.</span>&mdash;The
literature of the Mississippi Scheme is
extensive, and includes the relations of Law’s
system to general monetary science. The Mississippi
excitement instigated the South Sea
Scheme in England. Holland, also, was largely
affected, and gave, as well as England and
France, considerable additions to the contemporary
mass of brochures which grew out of
these financial revolutions. Law’s own pleas
and expositions, as issued in pamphlets, are the
central sources of his own views or pretensions,
and are included in the <i>Œuvres de J. Law</i>, published
at Paris in 1790. These writings are
again found in Daire’s <i>Économistes financiers;</i>
where will also be met the <i>Essai politique sur le
commerce</i> of Melon, Law’s secretary,&mdash;a production
which Levasseur styles an allegorical history
of the system,&mdash;and the <i>Réflexions politiques
sur les finances et le commerce</i> of Dutot, another
of Law’s partisans, who was one of the cashiers
of the Company of the Indies, and undertook
to correct what he thought misconceptions in
Melon; and he was in turn criticised by an opponent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of Law, Paris Duverney, in a little book
printed at the Hague in 1740, as <i>Examen du
livre intitulé, etc.</i></p>

<p>Law’s proposal for his Mississippi Company
is also included in a Dutch collection of similar
propositions, printed at the Hague in 1721 as
<i>Verzameling van alle de projecten en conditien van
de compagnien van assuratie</i>, etc.</p>

<p>There are various <i>Lettres patentes</i>, <i>Édits</i>,
<i>Arrests</i>, <i>Ordonnances</i>, etc., issued separately by
the French Government, some of which are
included in a volume published at Amsterdam
in 1720,&mdash;<i>Recueil d’arrests et autres pièces pour
l’établissement de la compagnie d’occident</i>. Others
will be found, by title at least, in the <i>Recueil
général des anciennes lois Françoises</i> (Paris, 1830),
vol. xxi., with the preambles given at length of
some of the more important. Neither of these
collections is complete, nor does that of Duhautchamp
take their place; but all three, doubtless,
contain the chief of such documents.</p>

<p>A few of the contemporary publications may
be noted:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Some Considerations on the Consequences of
the French settling Colonies on the Mississippi,
from a Gentleman</i> [Beresford] <i>of America to his
Friend in London</i>, London, 1720 (Carter-Brown,
vol. iii. no. 275).</p>

<p><i>Impartial Inquiry into the Right of the French
King to the Territory west of the Mississippi</i>
(London, n. d.).</p>

<p><i>The Chimera; or, the French way of paying
National Debts laid open</i> (London, 1720).</p>

<p><i>Full and Impartial Account of the Company
of the Mississippi ... projected and settled by Mr.
Law</i>. To which is added a <i>Description of the
Country of the Mississippi and a Relation of the
Discovery of it, in Two Letters from a Gentleman to
his Friend</i> (London, 1720). In French and English
(cf. Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no. 276). This is
an incentive to the speculation.</p>

<p><i>Historische und geographische Beschreibung des
an dem grossen Flusse Mississippi in Nord America
gelegenen herrlichen Landes Louisiana</i>, etc. (Leipsic,
1720) 8vo. It has a map of Louisiana. There
was a second edition the same year in 12mo,
with <i>Ausführliche</i> beginning a title otherwise the
same (Carter-Brown, vol. iii. nos. 277, 278). It
has an appendix, <i>Remarques über den Mississippischen
Actien-Handel</i>, which is a translation of
a section on Louisiana in <i>Aanmerkigen over den
koophandel en het geldt</i>, published at Amsterdam
(Muller, <i>Books on America</i>, 1872, nos. 915, 916;
1877, no. 1817).</p>

<p><i>Le banquerotteur en desespoir; Das ist, der versweifflende
Banquerottirer</i>, etc., with a long explanation
in German of the lament of a victim, dated
1720, without place, and purporting to be printed
from a Dutch copy (cf. Carter-Brown, ii. 258).</p>

<p><i>Het Groote Tafereel der Dwaasheid, vertoonende
de opkomst, voortgang en ondergang der Actie,
Bubbel en Windnegotie in Vrankryk, Engeland en
de Nederlanden, gepleegt in dem Jaare DDCCXX.</i>
(1720). This is a folio volume of satire, interesting
for its plates, most of which are burlesques;
but among them are a full-length portrait of
Law, another of Mrs. Law in her finery, and a
map of Louisiana. There is a copy in Harvard
College Library. Cf. Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no.
270; Muller, <i>Books on America</i> (1872), no. 1503.</p>

<p>There is in the Boston Public Library a
contemporary manuscript entitled, <i>Mémoire
d’après les voyages par Charles Le Gac, directeur
de la Comp. des Indes à la Louisiane, sur la Louisiane,
sa géographie, la situation de la colonie
Française, du 26 aoust 1718 au 6 mars 1721, et
des moyens de l’améliorer. Manuscrit redigé
en 1722</i>. Le Gac was the agent of Law’s Company
during these years.</p>

<p>The earliest personal sketch which we have
noted is a <i>Leven en character van J. Law</i>
(Amsterdam, 1722).</p>

<p><i>A Sketch of the Life and Projects of John Law</i>
was published in Edinburgh in 1791, afterward
included in J. P. Wood’s <i>Ancient and Modern
State of the Parish of Cramond</i> (Edinburgh,
1794), and the foundation of the later <i>Life of
John Law of Lauriston</i>, published by Wood at
Edinburgh in 1824. This may be supplemented
in some points by Chambers’s <i>Biographical Dictionary
of Eminent Scotsmen</i>.</p>

<p>Professor Smyth found, when he assigned
one of his <i>Lectures on Modern History</i> (no. 27)
to Law and his exploits, that he got at that time
the best exposition for his system in English
from Steuart’s <i>Political Economy</i>. The latest
summarized statement in English will be found
in Lalor’s <i>Cyclopædia of Political Science</i>, vol. ii.
(1883), and a good one in Mackay’s <i>Popular Delusions</i>.
The general historians of England, more
particularly Stanhope, do not tell the story of the
great imitatory pageant of the South Sea Scheme
without more or less reference to Law. Those
of the United States necessarily recount the
train of events in Paris, of which Louisiana was
the background. A few English monographs,
like J. Murray’s <i>French Financiers under Louis
XV.</i>, and an anonymous book, <i>Law, the Financier,
his Scheme and Times</i> (London, 1856), cover
specially the great projector’s career; while the
best key to his fate at the hands of magazinists
will be found in Poole’s <i>Index to Periodical
Literature</i> (pp. 728, 854), where a popular exposition
by Irving is noted, which having appeared
in the <i>Knickerbocker Magazine</i> (vol. xv.
pp. 305, 450), has since been included in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
volume of his works called <i>Wolfert’s Roost, and
other Papers</i>.</p>

<p>In France the treatment of the great delusion
has been frequent. The chief source of
later writers has been perhaps Duhautchamp’s
<i>Histoire du systéme des finances</i> (à la Haye, 1739),
which, with his account of the Visa, makes a full
exposition of the rise and fall of the excitement
by one who was in the midst of it. His fifth and
sixth volumes contain the most complete body
of the legislation attending the movement. Forbonnais’
<i>Recherches et considérations sur les
finances de France à l’année 1721</i> (Basle, 1758)
is a work of great research, and free from prejudice.
The <i>Encyclopédie méthodique</i> (1783) in
its essays on commerce and banking contributes
valuable aid, and there is a critical review in
Ch. Ganilh’s <i>Essai sur le revenu public</i> (Paris,
1806). To these may be added Bailly’s <i>Histoire
financière de la France</i> (Paris, 1830); Eugène
Daire’s “Notice historique sur Jean Law, ses
écrits et les opérations du système,” in his
<i>Économistes financiers du dix-huitième siècle</i>
(1843); Théodore Vial’s <i>Law, et le système du
papier-monnaie de 1716</i> (1849); A. Cochut’s <i>Law,
son système et son époque</i> (1853); J. B. H. R.
Capefigue’s <i>Histoire des grandes opérations financières</i>
(Paris, 1855), vol. i. p. 116; J. P. Clément’s
<i>Portraits historiques</i> (1856); and le Baron Nervo’s
<i>Les finances Françaises</i> (Paris, 1863). L. A.
Thiers’ encyclopedic article on Law was translated
and annotated by Frank S. Fiske as
<i>Memoir of the Mississippi Bubble</i>, and published
in New York in 1859. This is perhaps the best
single book for an English reader, who may
find in an appendix to it the account of the
Darien Expedition from the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>,
and one of the South Sea Scheme
from Mackay’s <i>Popular Delusions</i>. Thiers’
French text was at the same time revised and
published separately in Paris in 1858. Among
other French monographs P. E. Levasseur’s
<i>Recherches historiques sur le système de Law</i>
(Paris, 1854, and again, 1857) is perhaps the
most complete treatment which the subject has
yet received. We may further add Jules
Michelet’s “Paris et la France sous Law” in the
<i>Revue de deux mondes</i>, 1863, vol. xliv.; and the
general histories of France, notably Martin’s and
Guizot’s, of which there are English versions;
the special works on the reign of Louis XV.,
like De Tocqueville’s; P. E. Lémontey’s <i>Histoire
de la Régence</i> (Paris, 1832); J. F. Marmontel’s
<i>Régence du duc de Orléans</i> (1805), vol. i. p. 168;
and the conglomerate monograph of La Croix,
<i>Dix-huitième siècle</i> (Paris, 1875), chap. viii. Law
finds his most vigorous defender in Louis Blanc,
in a chapter of the introduction to his <i>Révolution
Française</i>.</p>

<p>The Germans have not made their treatment
of the subject very prominent, but reference may
be made to J. Heymann’s <i>Law und sein System</i>
(1853).</p>

<p>The strong dramatic contrasts of Law’s career
have served the English novelist Ainsworth in
a story which is known by the projector’s name;
but the reader will better get all the contrasts
and extraordinary vicissitudes of the social
concomitants of the time in the <i>Mémoires</i> of St.
Simon, Richelieu, Pollnitz, Barbier, Dangeau,
Duclos, and others.</p>

<p>The familiarity of Mr. Davis with the subject
has been of great assistance to the Editor in
making this survey.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>II.</b> <span class="smcap">The Story of Moncacht-Apé.</span>&mdash;The
writer of this chapter has, in the <i>Proceedings of
the American Antiquarian Society</i>, April 25, 1883,
printed a paper on the story of Moncacht-Apé,&mdash;an
Indian of the Yazoo tribe, who claimed to
have made a journey from the Mississippi to the
Pacific about the year 1700, which paper has
also been printed separately as <i>The Journey of
Moncacht-Apé</i>. The story, which first appeared
in Le Page du Pratz’ contributions to the
<i>Journal œconomique</i>, and first took permanent
form in Dumont’s <i>Mémoires</i> in 1753, was
made in part to depend for its ethnological
interest on the Yazoo marrying a captive Indian,
who tells him a story of bearded white men
being seen on the Pacific coast. That the
Yazoo himself encountered on the Pacific coast
a bearded people who came there annually in
ships for dye-wood, is derived from the fuller
narrative which Le Page du Pratz himself gives
in his <i>Histoire de la Louisiane</i> published five
years later, in 1758.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis does not find any consideration
of the verity of the story till Samuel Engel
discussed it in his <i>Mémoires et observations
géographiques</i>, published at Lausanne in 1765,
which had a chart showing what he conceived
to be the route of the Indian, as Le Page du
Pratz had traced it, in tracking him from the Missouri
to the streams which feed the Columbia
River. The story was later examined by Mr.
Andrew Stewart in <i>The Transactions of the
Literary and Historical Society of Quebec</i>, i.
198 (1829), who accepted the tale as truthful;
and Greenhow, in his <i>History of Oregon</i> (Boston,
1844, p. 145), rejects as improbable only the
ending as Dumont gives it. In 1881, when
M. de Quatrefage rehearsed the story in the
<i>Revue d’anthropologie</i>, vol. iv., he argued that
the bearded men must have been Japanese.
It was this paper of the distinguished French
anthropologist which incited Mr. Davis to the
study of the narrative; and it is by his discrimination
that we are reminded how the
story grew to have the suspicious termination,
after Le Page had communicated it to Dumont;
so that in Mr. Davis’s judgment one is “forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to the unwilling conclusion that the original
story of the savage suffered changes at Le Page’s
hands.” The story has since been examined by
H. H. Bancroft in his <i>Northwest Coast</i>, i. 599
<i>et seq.</i>, who sees no reason to doubt the truth
of the narrative.</p>

<p>There is an account of the early maps of the
country west of Lake Superior and of the headwaters
of the Mississippi in Winchell’s <i>Geological
Survey of Minnesota, Final Report</i>, vol. i.,
with a fac-simile of one of 1737. Between 1730
and 1740 Verendrye and his companions explored
the country west and northwest of Lake
Superior, and reached the Rocky Mountains.
Mills, <i>Boundaries of Ontario</i>, p. 75, says he failed
to find in the <i>Moniteur</i>, September and November,
1857, the account of Verendrye’s discoveries
by Margry, to which Garneau refers.</p>

<p>In Vol. IV. of the present <i>History</i> the earliest
maps of the Mississippi Basin are enumerated,
and fac-similes or sketches of the following
may be seen in that volume:&mdash;</p>

<p>1672-73 (p. 221). An anonymous map of the
course of the Mississippi, which is also to be
found in Breese’s <i>Early Hist. of Illinois</i>. Other
early maps, without date, are noted in Vol. IV.
at pp. 206, 215.</p>

<p>1673-74 (pp. 208, 212, 214, 218). Joliet’s
maps; and (p. 220) Marquette’s map, which has
since been reproduced in Andreas’s <i>Chicago</i>, i.
p. 47.</p>

<p>1682-84-88 (pp. 227, 228, 230, 231). Franquelin’s
maps,&mdash;the last of which has since
been reproduced in Winchell’s <i>Geological Survey
of Minnesota, Final Report</i>, i. pl. 2.</p>

<p>1683-97 (pp. 249, 251, 252, 253). Hennepin’s
maps, also to be found in Winchell and Breese.</p>

<p>1685 (p. 237).  Minet’s map; and without
date (p. 235) the map of Raudin. The map
which accompanied Joutel’s <i>Journal</i> in 1713
also gave the topography of the time of Lasalle.
(See p. 240.)</p>

<p>1688 (p. 232). The map of Coronelli and
Tillemon; and (p. 233) that of Raffeix.</p>

<p>1702 (p. 394). The map in Campanius.</p>

<p>1703-1709 (pp. 258, 259, 260, 261). Maps in
Lahontan.</p>

<p class="p2">It is in continuation of this series, which includes
others not here mentioned, that the following
enumeration is offered of the cartographical
results which controlled and developed the
maps of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The plates of the maps of Nicolas Sanson,
who had died in 1667,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> were towards the end
of that century in the hands of Hubert Jaillot,
who was later a royal geographer of France.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
He published in Paris, in 1692, what passes for
Sanson’s <i>Amérique Septentrionale</i>, with adaptations
to contemporary knowledge of American
geography. It naturally augments the claims
of the French to the disputed areas of the continent.
It was reissued at Amsterdam not long
after as “Dressée sur les observations de M<sup>rs</sup>
de l’Academie Royale des Sciences.” The
plate was long in use in Amsterdam, and I have
noticed reissues as late as 1755 by Ottens.</p>

<p>The English claims to the westward at this
time will be seen in “The Plantations of England
in America,” contained in Edward Wells’
<i>New Sett of Maps</i>, London, 1698-99.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The most distinguished French cartographers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the early part of the eighteenth century were
the father and son, Claude and Guillaume Delisle.
The father, Claude, died in 1720 at 76;
the son, six years later, in 1726, at 51.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Their
maps of <i>Amérique Septentrionale</i> were published
at Paris of various dates in the first quarter of
the century, and were reissued at Amsterdam.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
Their <i>Carte de la Louisiane et du Cours du
Mississipi</i> appeared first at Paris in 1703, and
amended copies appeared at various later dates.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Thomassy<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> refers to an original draft by Guillaume
Delisle, <i>Carte de la rivière du Mississipi,
dressée sur les mémoires de M. Le Sueur</i>, 1702,
which is preserved in the Archives Scientifiques
de la Marine, at Paris. Thomassy (p. 211) also
refers to an edition of Delisle’s <i>Carte de la Louisiane</i>,
published in June, 1718, by the Compagnie
d’Occident. Gov. Burnet wrote of this map to
the Lords of Trade<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, that Delisle had taken
from the borders of New York and Pennsylvania
fifty leagues of territory, which he had allowed
to the English in his map of 1703.</p>

<p>There is an Amsterdam edition (1722) of Delisle’s
<i>Carte du Mexique et de La Floride, des
Terres Angloises et des Isles Antilles, du Cours
et des Environs de la Rivière de Mississipi</i>, measuring
24 × 19 inches, which includes nearly the
whole of North America.</p>

<p>Nicholas de Fer was at this time the royal
geographer of Belgium, 1701-1716.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> We note
several of his maps:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Les Costes aux Environs de la Rivière de Misissipi,
par N. de Fer</i>, 1701. This extends from
Cape Roman (Carolina) to the Texas coast, and
shows the Mississippi up to the “Nihata” village.
There is a copy in the Sparks MSS., vol.
xxviii.</p>

<p><i>Le Vieux Mexique avec les Costes de la Floride,
par N. de Fer,</i> 1705. This extends south to the
Isthmus of Panama. There is a copy in the
Sparks MSS., vol. xxviii.</p>

<p><i>Le Canada ou Nouvelle France</i>, Paris, 1705.
There is a copy in the Sparks MSS., vol. xxviii.
It shows North America from Labrador to Florida,
and includes the Mississippi valley. The
region west of the Alleghanies is given to
France, as well as the water-shed of the lower
St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>De Fer also published, in 1717, <i>Le Golfe de
Mexique et les provinces et isles qui l’environne</i>
[sic].</p>

<p>In 1718 his <i>Le Cours du Mississipi ou de Saint
Louis</i> was published by the Compagnie d’Occident.</p>

<p>Making a part of Herman Moll’s <i>New and
exact Map of the Dominions of the King of Great
Britain on the Continent of North America</i>,
measuring 24 × 40 inches, issued in 1715, was a
lesser draft called <i>Louisiana, with the indian
settlements and number of fighting men according
to the account of Capt. T. Nearn.</i><a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>When Moll, in 1720, published his <i>New Map
of the North Parts of America claimed by France
under the name of Louisiana, Mississippi, Canada,
and New France, with the adjoining territories
of England and Spain</i> (measuring 24 × 40
inches), he said that a great part of it was taken
from “the original draughts of Mr. Blackmore,
the ingenious Mr. Berisford, now residing in
Carolina, Capt. Nairn, and others never before
published.” He adds that the southwest part
followed a map by Delisle, published in Paris
in June, 1718.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>In 1719 the Sieur Diron made observations
for a map preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale
at Paris, <i>Fleuve Saint Louis, ci-devant
Mississipi</i>, showing the course of the river
from New Orleans to Cahokia, which was not
drawn, however, till 1732.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> About the same
time (1719-20) the surveys of M. De Sérigny
were used in another map, preserved in the
Archives Scientifiques de la Marine, <i>Carte des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Côtes de la Louisiane depuis les bouches du
Mississipi jusqu’à la baie de Saint-Joseph</i>. Part
of the gulf shore of this map is reproduced in
Thomassy (plate ii.).</p>

<p>The year 1719 is also assigned to John Senex’s
<i>Map of Louisiana and the river Mississipi,
most humbly inscribed to Law of Lawreston</i>,
measuring 22 X 19 inches.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Gerard van Keulen published at Amsterdam,
in 1720, a large map, in two sheets, <i>Carte de
la Nouvelle France ou se voit le cours des grandes
Rivières Mississipi et S. Laurens</i>, with annotations
on the French fortified posts.</p>

<p>At Paris, in November, 1720, De Beauvilliers
took the observations of La Harpe and
drafted a <i>Carte nouvelle de la parte de l’ouest
de la province de la Louisiane</i>.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The map of Coxe’s <i>Carolana, 1722</i>, is given
in fac-simile on an earlier page (<i>ante</i>, p. 70).</p>

<p>The <i>Memoirs of John Ker of Kersland</i> (London,
1726) contain a “new map of Louisiana,
and the river Mississipi.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The map in La Potherie’s <i>Histoire de l’Amérique
Septentrionale</i> (Paris, 1722, vol. ii.), called
“Carte généralle de la Nouvelle France,” retains
the misplacement of the mouths of the
Mississippi, as La Salle had conceived them to be
on the western shore of the gulf, giving the
name “Baye de Spiritu Sancto” to an inlet
more nearly in the true position of its mouths.</p>

<p>Thomassy<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> points out that William Darby,
in his <i>Geographical Description of Louisiana</i> (2d
ed. 1817), in reproducing Jean Baptiste Homann’s
map of Louisiana, published at Nuremberg
as the earliest of the country which he
could find, was unfortunate in accepting for
such purpose a mere perversion of the earlier
and original French maps. Homann, moreover,
was one of those geographers of easy conscience,
who never or seldom date a map, and
the German cartographer seems in this instance
to have done little more than reëngrave the
map which accompanied the Paris publication
of Joutel’s <i>Journal historique</i>, in 1713. Homann’s
map, called <i>Amplisimæ regionis Mississipi
seu Provinciæ Ludovicianæ a Hennepin detectæ
anno 1687</i>, was published not far from
1730, and extending so as to include Acadia,
Lake Superior, and Texas, defines the respective
bounds of the English, French, and Spanish
possessions.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>When Moll published his <i>New Survey of the
Globe</i>, in 1729, he included in it (no. 27) a map
of New France and Louisiana, showing how they
hemmed in the English colonies.</p>

<p>Henry Popple’s <i>Map of the British Empire
in America, with the French and Spanish Settlements
adjacent thereto</i>, was issued in London in
twenty sheets, under the patronage of the Lords
of Trade, in 1732; and reissued in 1733 and
1740.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> A reproduction was published at Amsterdam,
about 1737, by Covens and Mortier.
Popple’s map was for the Mississippi valley,
in large part based on Delisle’s map of 1718.</p>

<p>Jean Baptiste D’Anville was in the early
prime of his activity when the Delisles passed
off the stage, having been born in 1697, and a
long life was before him, for he did not die
till 1782, having gained the name of being the
first to raise geography to the dignity of an
exact science.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> He had an instinct for physical
geography, and gained credit for his critical
discrimination between conflicting reports,
which final surveys verified. His principal <i>Carte
de la Louisiane</i> was issued as “Dressée en
1732; publiée en 1752.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> His map of <i>Amérique
Septentrionale</i> usually bears date 1746-48;
and a new draft of it, with improvements, was
published at Nuremberg in 1756.</p>

<p>A map made by Dumont de Montigny about
1740, <i>Carte de la province de la Louisiane, autrefois
le Mississipi</i>, preserved in the Dépôt de la
Marine at Paris, is said by Thomassy (p. 217)
to be more valuable for its historical legends
than for its geography.</p>

<p>In 1744 the maps of Nicolas Bellin were attached
to the <i>Nouvelle France</i> of Charlevoix,
and they include, beside the map of North
America, a <i>Carte de la Louisiane, Cours du Mississipi,
et pais voisins</i>.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Bellin’s <i>Carte des embouchures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
du fleuve Saint-Louis</i> (1744) is based
on a draft by Buache (1732), following an original
manuscript (1731) preserved in the Archives
Scientifiques de la Marine, in Paris.</p>

<p>Bellin also dates in 1750 a <i>Carte de la Louisiane
et des pays voisins</i>, and in an atlas of his,
<i>Amérique Septentrionale, Atlas maritime</i>, published
in 1764 by order of the Duc de Choiseul,
Bellin includes various other and even earlier
maps of Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Thomassy<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> also refers to a MS. map in the
Bibliothèque Nationale, <i>Carte de la Coste et
Province de la Louisiane</i>, dated at New Orleans,
October 5, 1746, which is not, however, of
much value.</p>

<p>There is a “Carte de la Louisiane” in Dumont
de Montigny’s <i>Mémoires historiques de la
Louisiane</i>, vol. i. (1753), a fac-simile of which is
given herewith. It perhaps follows the one referred
to above.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>There is on a later page a fac-simile of the map,
showing the carrying-place between the St. Lawrence
and Mississippi valleys, which appeared
in the London (1747 and 1755) editions of Cadwallader
Colden’s <i>History of the Five Indian
Nations of Canada</i>.</p>

<p>The controversy over the bounds of the
French and English possessions, which was so
unproductive of results in 1755, caused a large
number of maps to be issued, representing the
interests of either side. The French claimed
in the main the water-shed of the St. Lawrence
and the lakes, and that of the Mississippi
and its tributaries. The English conceded
to them a southern limit following the
St. Lawrence and the Ottawa, thence across
Huron and Michigan, to the Illinois, descending
that river to the Mississippi; and consequently
denied them the southern water-shed
of the St. Lawrence and most of the eastern
water-shed of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>On the French side the following maps may
be named:&mdash;</p>

<p>The great D’Anville map, <i>Canada, Louisiane,
et les terres anglaises</i>, which was followed in the
next year (1756) by D’Anville’s <i>Mémoire</i> on the
same map; Robert de Vaugondy’s <i>Partie de
l’Amérique Septentrionale qui comprend le Cours
de l’Ohio, la N<sup>lle</sup> Angleterre, la N<sup>lle</sup> York, New
Jersey, Pensylvanie, Maryland, Virginie, Caroline;
Carte Nouvelle de l’Amérique Angloise contenant
le Canada, la Nouvelle Ecosse ou Acadie,
les treize Provinces unies, avec la Floride, par
Matthieu Albert Lotter</i>, published at Augsburg,
without date; <i>Carte des possessions Angloises et
Françoises du Continent de l’Amérique Septentrionale</i>,
published by Ottens at Amsterdam, 1755;
<i>Carte de l’Amérique Septentrionale, par M. Bellin</i>,
1755; in the same year the <i>Partie Orientale,
et partie Occidentale de la Nouvelle France ou du
Canada</i>, likewise by Bellin;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and the <i>Carte de
la Louisiane par le Sieur Bellin, 1750, sur de
nouvelles Observations on a corrigé les lacs, et
leurs environs, 1755; Canada et Louisiane, par le
Sieur le Rouge, ingénieur géographe du Roi</i>, Paris,
1755, with a marginal map of the Mississippi
River.</p>

<p>In the English interests there were several
leading maps: <i>A new and accurate map of
North America (wherein the errors of all preceding
British, French, and Dutch maps respecting
the rights of Great Britain, France, and Spain,
and the limits of each of His Majesty’s Provinces
are corrected), by Huske</i>. This was engraved
by Thomas Kitchin, and published by Dodsley
at London, 1755. It gives the names of the
French trading posts and stations. John Huske
also printed <i>The Present State of North America,
Part I.</i>, London, 1755, which appeared in a
2d edition the same year with emendations,
giving Huske’s map, colored, leaving the encroachments
of the French uncolored. It was
also reprinted in Boston, in the same year.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Another is <i>A map of the British Colonies in
North America, with the roads, distances, limits,
and extent of the settlements</i>. This is John
Mitchell’s map, in six sheets, engraved by
Kitchin, published in London by Jefferys and
Faden, 1755. John Pownall, under date of
February 13, 1755, certifies to the approval of
the Lords of Trade.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> It was reëngraved, with
improvements, a year or two later, at Amsterdam,
by Covens and Mortier, under the title
<i>Map of the British and French Dominions in

taken the field, for his assistance in entering
upon the disputed territory of the Ohio Valley,&mdash;indeed,
its publication was hastened by that

           <p class="pf400">This is sketched from the colored folding map in John Huske’s <i>Present State of North America, &amp;c.</i>,
second edition, London, 1755. The easterly of the two pricked (dots) lines marks the limits within which the
French claimed to confine the English seaboard colonies. Canada, or the region north of the St. Lawrence,
east of the Ottawa, and south of the Hudson Bay Company and New Britain, together with the islands in
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the northerly coasts of Newfoundland (to dry fish upon), constitute all that
the British allowed to France. The stars represent the forts which they had established in the disputed
territory; while the circle and dot show the frontier fortified posts of the English, as Huske gives them.
The English claimed for the province of New York all the territory north of the Virginia line, west of Pennsylvania,
and west of the Ottawa, and south of the Hudson Bay Company’s line. Virginia, the two Carolinas,
and Georgia extended indefinitely westward. The northern line of Virginia was established by the charter of
1606; the southern bounds mark where the Carolina charter of 1665 begins, and the bounds of Spanish Florida
denote that charter’s southern limit, the territory being divided by the subsequent grant of Georgia. The space
between the pricked line, already mentioned, and the other pricked line, which follows the Mississippi River
to the north, is the land which is called in a legend on the map the hereditary and conquered country of the
Iroquois, which had been ceded by them to the British crown by treaties and a deed of sale (1701), and confirmed
by the treaties of Utrecht and Aix-la-Chapelle. Cf. <i>Description of the English and French territories
in North America, being an explanation of a new map, shewing the encroachments of the French,
with their Forts and Usurpations on the English settlements; and the fortifications of the latter.</i> Dublin,
1755 (Carter-Brown, iii. 1056).</p>

<p>Jefferys pirated Evans’ map, and published
it in 1758, “with improvements by I. Gibson,”
and in this form it is included in Jefferys’
<i>General Topography of North America and the
West Indies</i>, London, 1768. Pownall, who was
accused of procuring the dedication of the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
issue by “a valuable consideration” (<i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i>, vii. 136), called Jefferys’ reproduction
badly done, and reissued Evans’ work in
1776, under the following title: <i>A map of the
Middle British Colonies in North America, first
published by Mr. Lewis Evans of Philadelphia in
1755, and since corrected and improved, as also extended
... from actual surveys now lying at the
Board of Trade, by T. Pownall, M. P., Printed
and published for J. Almon, London, March 25,
1776</i>. In this form the original plate was used
as “Engraved by James Turner in Philadelphia,”
embodying some corrections, while the
extensions consisted of an additional engraved
sheet, carrying the New England coasts from
Buzzard’s to Passamaquoddy Bay.</p>

<p>A French copy, with amendments, was published
in 1777.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The map was also reëngraved in London,
“carefully copied from the original published
at Philadelphia by Mr. Lewis Evans.” It omits
the dedication to Pownall, and is inscribed
“Printed for Carrington Bowles, London; published,
Jan. 1, 1771.” It has various legends
not on Evans’ map, and omits some details,
notwithstanding its professed correspondence.
Evans had used the Greek character [Greek: ch] to express
the <i>gh</i> of the Indian names, which is
rendered in the Bowles map <i>ch</i>.</p>

<p>Another plate of Evans’ map was engraved
in London, and published there by Sayer and
Bennett, Oct. 15, 1776, to show the “seat of
war.” It covers the same field as the map of
1755, and uses the same main title; but it is
claimed to have been “improved from several
surveys made after the late war, and corrected
from Governor Pownall’s late map, 1776.” The
side map is extended so as to include Lake
Superior, and is called “A sketch of the upper
parts of Canada.” Smith (1756) says: “Evans’
map and first pamphlet were published in the
summer, 1755, and that part in favor of the
French claim to Frontenac was attacked by
two papers in the <i>N. Y. Mercury</i>, Jan. 5, 1756.
This occasioned the publication of a second
pamphlet the next spring, in which he endeavors
to support his map.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Evans’ pamphlet is called <i>Geographical, historical,
political, philosophical, and mechanical
essays. The first, containing an analysis of a
general map of the middle British colonies in
America; and of the country of the confederate
Indians</i> [etc.]. Philadelphia, 1755. iv. 32 pp.
4º. A second edition, with the title unchanged,
appeared the same year, while “Part ii.” was
published in the following year.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>By Gen. Shirley’s order N. Alexander made a
map of the frontier posts from New York to
Virginia, which is noted in the <i>Catal. of the
King’s maps</i> (British Museum), ii. 24. This
may be a duplicate of a MS. map said by Parkman
(i. p. 422) to be in the Public Record office,
<i>America and West Indies</i>, lxxxii., showing the
position of thirty-five posts from the James
River to Esopus on the Hudson.</p>

<p>Le Page du Pratz gave a “Carte de la Louisiane,
par l’Auteur, 1757,” in his <i>Histoire de la
Louisiane</i> (vol. i. p. 138), a part of which map
is reproduced herewith. See also <i>ante</i>, p. 66.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, 1757, p. 74, is
“A map of that part of America which was the
principal seat of war in 1756,” defining the Ottawa
River as the bounds under the treaty of
Utrecht.</p>

<p>Janvier’s <i>L’Amérique</i>, in 1760, carried the
bounds of Louisiana to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Pouchot, in a letter dated at Montreal, April
14, 1758, describes a map, which he gives in
his <i>Mémoires</i>, vol. iii., where it is called “Carte
des frontières Françoises et Angloises dans le
Canada depuis Montreal jusques au Fort Du
Quesne.” It is reproduced in Dr. Hough’s
translation of Pouchot, in the <i>Pennsylvania
Archives</i>, second series, vi. p. 409, and in <i>N. Y.
Col. Hist.</i>, vol. x.</p>

<p>In 1760 Thomas Jefferys included a map of
Canada and the north part of Louisiana in
<i>The Natural and Civil History of the French
Dominion in North and South America</i>, purporting
to be “from the French of Mr. D’Anville,
improved with the back settlements of
Virginia and course of the Ohio, illustrated
with geographical and historical remarks,” with
marginal tables of “French Incroachments,”
and “English titles to their settlements on the
Continent.” This map ran the northern bounds
of the English possessions along the St. Lawrence,
up the Ottawa, across the lakes, and
down the Illinois and the Mississippi. The
northern bounds of Canada follow the height
of land defining the southern limits of the Hudson
Bay Company.</p>

<p>After the peace of 1763, Jefferys inserted copies
of this map (dated 1762) in the <i>Topography
of North America and the West Indies</i> (London,
1768), adding to it, “the boundaries of
the Provinces since the Conquest laid down as
settled by the King in Council.” The map of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
1762 is reproduced in Mills’ <i>Boundaries of Ontario</i>.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Jefferys also gave in the same book (1768) a
map of the mouths of the Mississippi and the
neighboring coasts, which, he says, was taken
from several Spanish and French drafts, compared
with D’Anville’s of 1752 and with P.
Laval’s <i>Voyage à Louisiane</i>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">NEW ENGLAND, 1689-1763.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY JUSTIN WINSOR,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>The Editor</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">ANDROS, with Joseph Dudley and other satellites, made safe in Castle
William, the revolution in New England was accomplished, and
the veteran Simon Bradstreet was at the head of the old government
on its sudden restoration (1689) to power.</p>

<p>The traditions of the charter-days were still strong among the country
people, and their deputies in the resuscitated assembly brought into
Boston the old spirit of independence to enliven the stifled atmosphere
which the royal governor had spread upon the town. The new government
was proposedly a provisional one to await the result of the revolution
which seemed impending in England. If the policy of unwavering
adherence to the old charter had been pursued with the constancy which
characterized the advocacy of Elisha Cooke, the popular tribune of the
day, the current of the New England history for the next few years
might possibly have been changed. The sturdy assumption of political
power did not follow the bold revolution which had prepared the way
for it, and, professing dependence upon the royal will, all thoughts were
now addressed to placate the new monarch, and regain by law what they
had failed to achieve by a dogged assertion of right. King William, of
whose accession they soon were notified, unhesitatingly, but for temporary
service, confirmed the existing rulers.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>A command came for Andros to be sent to England, with a presentation
of charges against him, and it was obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Increase Mather had
already gone there to join Ashurst, the resident agent of the colony,
and the people were not without hope that through the urgency of these
representatives the restitution of the old charter might be confirmed.
Subsequently Elisha Cooke and Thomas Oakes were despatched to reinforce
the others. Mather, either because he felt the project a vain one,
or because he hoped, under a new deal, to be better able to direct affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was favoring a new charter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pf400">This follows the map in the Amsterdam
ed. (1688) of Richard Blome’s <i>L’Amérique, traduit
de l’Anglois</i>. This is a different map (on
a larger scale) from the one in the original English
edition of Blome. See reference to the
map given in Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i> (1702) in Vol.
III. p. 345. This map is reproduced in Cassell’s
<i>United States</i>, i. pp. 492, 516.</p>

<p class="pf400">Douglass, with some excess, again speaks of
Mather’s map (<i>Summary</i>, etc., i. 362) “as composed
from some old rough drafts of the first
discoverers, with obsolete names not known at
this time, and has scarce any resemblance of the
country,” and he calls Cyprian Southack’s maps
and charts even worse. For Southack see
<i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Plymouth, which had never had a royal
charter, was endeavoring, through the agency of Ichabod Wiswall,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> the
minister of Duxbury, who had been sent over to protect their interests,
to make the most of the present opportunity and get a favorable recognition
from the king. Between a project of annexation to New York
and Mather’s urging of an alternative annexation to the Bay, the weaker
colony fared hard, and its ultimate fate was fashioned against its will.
In the counsels of the four agents Cooke was strenuous for the old charter
at all hazards, and Oakes sustained him. Mather’s course was professedly
a politic one. He argued finally that a chance for the old charter
was gone, and that it would be wiser to succumb in season to the inevitable,
in order better to direct progress. When it came to a petition
for a new charter, Oakes so far smothered his sentiments as to sign it
with Mather; but Cooke held out to the last.</p>

          <p class="pf400">This follows a red-chalk drawing in the gallery
of the American Antiquarian Society, which
had belonged to the Rev. William Bentley, of
Salem, who was born in Boston in 1759, and
died in Salem in 1819.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Massachusetts was governing itself, and had enough to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in looking after its frontiers, particularly at the eastward, where the
withdrawal of the troops which Andros had placed there became the signal
for Indian outbreaks. New Hampshire, weak in her isolation, petitioned
to be taken under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, and was
(March 19, 1690) for the time being annexed.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Connecticut, destined to
save her charter by delays and a less fiery spirit, entered upon a career
characterized in the main by dignified quiet. Though she participated
in some of the tumult of the recurrent Indian wars, and let her bitterness
against episcopacy sometimes lead to violent acts, she had an existence
of much more content than fell to the lot of the other New England
colonies.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>The first momentous event which the restored governments had to
encounter was the disastrous expedition which Phips led against Quebec,
in 1690. With confident hope, the fleet on the 8th of August sailed from
Boston harbor, and the whole community for three months waited for
news with great solicitude. Scarce three weeks had passed when Sewall
records (August 28) that they got from Albany intelligence of the Mohawks’
defection, which, as he writes, “puts a great damp here to think
that our fleet should be disappointed of their expected aid.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Apprehension
of some more imminent danger grew throughout the colony. In
September they placed watches at night throughout Boston, and gave as
watchwords “Schenectady” and “Salmon Falls,”&mdash;fearful reminders.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
One night at Charlestown there was an alarm because Indians were
seen in their back fields,&mdash;they proved to be runaway servants. Again,
the home guard, eight companies, trained another day. At last tidings
came from Plymouth of certain losses which the contingent of that colony,
among the forces acting at the eastward, had suffered, news whereof
had reached them. This and other matters were made the grounds of an
attempt to found a regular channel of communicating the current reports,
which in a little sheet called <i>Publick Occurrences</i> was issued at Boston,
Thursday, September 25, the precursor of the American newspaper. It
told the people of various incidents of their every-day life, and warned
them of its purpose to prevent false reports, and to correct the spirit
of lying, “which prevails among us.” It represented that “the chief
discourse of this month” was the ill-success of the expedition, which,
under the command of Gen. Winthrop, of Connecticut, had attempted to
advance on Montreal by way of Lake Champlain, to distract the enemy’s
attention in that direction while Phips ascended the St. Lawrence.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>About six weeks later, on Friday, November 7, word came to the governor
from Salem of the disastrous events in the St. Lawrence and the
discomfiture of Phips.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The unfortunate expedition had cost Massachusetts £50,000, and while
the colony was devising an illusory scheme of paper money as a quick
way of gathering taxes, Phips slipped off to England, with the hope that
his personal explanations would assist in inducing the home government
to lend a helping hand in some future attempt.</p>

<p>When Phips reached England he found that Mather had done good
work in preventing the reinstalling of Andros, as at one time was threatened.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Memorials and counter-memorials, printed and manuscript, were pressed
upon Parliament, by which that body was now urged to restore, and now
implored to deny, the vacated charter. It was at this juncture that
Mather, with two other agents, petitioned the king for a new charter;
and the law officers reporting favorably, the plan had already been committed
to the Lords of Trade at the time when Phips appeared in London.
With the assent of the king, the framing of a new charter was
entrusted to Sir George Treby, the Attorney General, who was instructed
to fortify the royal prerogative, and to make the jurisdiction include not
only Massachusetts, but the territory of New Plymouth and all that region,
or the better part of it, lying east of the present State of New
Hampshire, and stretching from the St. Lawrence to the Atlantic.</p>

<p>It was the dawn of a new existence, in which the province, as it now
came to be called, was to be governed by a royal governor, sent to enforce
the royal prerogative, to administer the navigation laws in the interests
of British merchants, to gratify the sectaries of the Established
Church, and to embarrass the old-fashioned theocracy. The chief power
reserved to the people was that of the purse,&mdash;an important one in any
event, and one that the legislative assembly knew how to wield, as the
years which followed proved.</p>

<p>Mather professed to think the new charter&mdash;and it perhaps was&mdash;the
best result, under the circumstances, to be attained. He talked about
the colony still having a chance of assuming the old charter at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
more opportune moment. Cooke, the champion of the old conditions,
was by no means backed in his opposition by a unanimity of feeling in the
colony itself; for many of the later comers, generally rich, were become
advocates of prerogative, and lived in the hope of obtaining more consequence
under a changed order of society. Connecticut and Rhode
Island were content, meanwhile, with the preservation of their own chartered
autonomy, such as it was.</p>

<p>Thus affairs were taking a turn which made Phips forget the object
of his visit. Mather seems to have been prepared for the decision, and
was propitiated also by the promise of being allowed to nominate the new
governor and his subordinates. Phips had been Mather’s parishioner in
Boston, and was ambitious enough to become his creature, if by doing so
he could secure preferment. So Sir William Phips was commissioned
Governor; and as a sort of concession to the clerical party, of which
Mather himself was the leader in Boston, William Stoughton was made
Lieutenant-Governor. Isaac Addington became Secretary. Bradstreet
was appointed first assistant. Danforth, Oakes, and Cooke, the advocates
of the old charter, were forgotten in the distribution of offices.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, January 26, 1692, Robin Orchard came to Boston from
Cape Cod, bringing tidings that Capt. Dolberry’s London packet was at
anchor in the harbor now known as Provincetown, and that she had
brought the news of the appointment of Phips under a new charter.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Boston was at this time the most considerable place in the New World,
and she probably had not far from 7,000 inhabitants; while Massachusetts,
as now constituted, included 75 towns, of which 17 belonged to Plymouth.
Within this enlarged jurisdiction the population ranged somewhere between
60,000 and 100,000,&mdash;for estimates widely vary. Out of this
number twenty-eight persons had been chosen to make the governor’s
council, but their places were to be made good at subsequent elections
by the assembly, though the governor could negative any objectionable
candidate; and the joint approval of the governor and council was necessary
to establish the members of the judiciary. The acts of the legislature
could for cause be rejected by the Privy Council any time within
three years, and to it they must be regularly submitted for approval; and
this proved to be no merely formal action. It meant much.</p>

<p>These conditions created a new political atmosphere for Massachusetts.
Religion and politics had in the old days gone hand in hand, and the
little book which Joshua Scottow, one of the old patriarchs, now printed,
<i>Old Men’s Tears</i>, forcibly reminded them of the change. The community
was more and more engrossed with trade; and those that concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
themselves with politics were not near so closely of one mind as formerly;
and there was lacking that invigorating motive of saving their charter
which had so unified the thoughts and banded the energies of the community
in former years.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May, 1692, the “Nonesuch” frigate cast anchor in Boston
harbor. When Phips and Mather disembarked, eight companies of
soldiers received and escorted them to their respective houses. “Made
no volleys, because ‘twas Satterday night,” says Sewall, recording the
event.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The ceremony of inauguration was no sooner over than all parties
began to take their bearings; and Mather, not long after,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> in an election
sermon, took occasion to defend the policy of his recent mission.
It remained to be seen how much the province was to gain from its closer
connection with the home government. Was it to claim and secure larger
assistance in repressing Indian outbreaks and repelling French encroachments?&mdash;for
these things were brought home to them by the arrival of
every messenger from the frontiers, by
the surveillance under which they had
put all Frenchmen who chanced to be
in their seaports, and by the loads of
wine-casks which paraded the streets of
Boston when the “Swan” (September
20, 1692) brought in a French prize. It
was not till October 23d that Cooke and
Oakes reached home, and the old-charter
party had once more its natural leaders;
Cooke, at least, bringing to it the influence
of wealth.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>In the sermon to which reference has
just been made, Mather showed that,
however he had carried many of his own points, he had failed in some
that much troubled him. The change in the qualification of electors
from church membership to the condition of freeholders was alarming
to those of the old theocratic sentiments. It meant a diminution of
their influence, and that the 120 churches in New England (of which
80 were in Massachusetts) were to direct much less than formerly the
legislation of the people. The possible three years which a law might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
live before the home-veto came must be made the most of. Using his
influence with Phips, Mather dictated the choice of the first corporation
of Harvard College, freshly chartered under the new rule, and without
waiting for the confirmation of the Privy Council, who might well be
thought to be opposed to a charter for the college which did not provide
some check in a board of visitors, he caused himself, very likely in
a passive way, to be made its first Doctor of Divinity, but his admirers
and creatures knew the reward he expected. We think, however, to-day
less of the legislation which gave such a title to their great man
than we do of the smaller ambitions by which the assembly of the province
about the same time were originating our public-school system.</p>

<p>The governor, in his communication to the General Court, reminded
them of the royal recommendation that they should fix by law a fitting
salary for the chief executive. It raised a point that Elisha Cooke was
in wait for. Under his instigation, the plan was devised of substituting
an annual grant, which might be raised or lowered, as circumstances warranted,
and as was necessary to vindicate one of the few rights left to
them by the charter. It was the beginning of a conflict that recurred
with each successive governor as he attempted to force or cajole the representatives
into some recognition of the royal wish.</p>

<p>The baleful influence of the Mathers&mdash;for the son Cotton was now
conspicuous&mdash;conduced to commit the unwary Phips to instituting a court,
which disgraced itself by the judicial murders attending the witchcraft
frenzy; and in the midst of all, Sir Francis Wheeler’s crippled fleet arrived
from the West Indies (June 11, 1693), having lost more than half
its men by disease. The fear of infection almost caused a panic among
the inhabitants of Boston when, two days later, Wheeler anchored his frigates
off Noddle’s Island. Ten days afterwards their commander was entertained
at Cambridge by the governor, and by Mather as president of
the college.</p>

<p>Connecticut was in the mean while serving both Massachusetts on the
east and New York on the west. She sent troops to help defend the
eastern dependencies of the Bay. On the retreat of Winthrop’s expedition,
New York appealed to Connecticut for help, and she afforded it;
but when Governor Fletcher, of New York, came to Hartford and claimed
command of her militia, she resisted his pretensions, and, as the story
goes, drowned the reading of his proclamation by a vigorous beating of
drums.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Fitz-John Winthrop was sent to England to compose matters,
and it ended in Connecticut placing 120 men at the disposal of the New
York governor, while she retained command of her home forces, and Winthrop
became in turn her governor.</p>

<p>Phips too went to England, but on a mission not so successful. His
testy character had early imperilled his administration. He got into a quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with Fletcher, of New York, and he yielded to passions which brought
undignified encounters even in the public streets. Representations of
such conduct did not fail to reach the king, and Phips was commanded
to appear in his own defence. His friends had endeavored to force an
address through the House of Representatives, praying the king not to
remove him; but it was defeated by the united action of members from
Boston, many of whom represented country towns. The governor’s
friends resorted to a specious device which appealed to the local pride of
the country; and, by the urgency of Mather and others, a bill requiring
the representatives to be residents of the town they sat for was forced
through the House.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> With an assembly constituted under the new rule,
a bare majority was secured for the address, and Phips took it with
him.</p>

<p>Before much progress could be made in the investigation, after his arrival
in London, he died on February 18, 1694-5.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The news did not
reach Boston till early in May. “People are generally sad,” says Sewall.
“Cousin Hall says the talk is Mr. Dudley will be governor,” and the next
day mourning guns were fired at the Castle.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Joseph Dudley’s hour of pride was not yet come, though he had intrigued
for appointment even before Phips’s death. The protests of Ashurst
and Constantine Phipps, the colony’s agents in London, were effectual;
and the king was by no means prepared as yet to alienate the feelings
of his New England subjects in order to gratify the avenging spirit of
Dudley. That recusant New Englander was put off with the lieutenant-governorship
of the Isle of Wight, a position which he held for nine
years.</p>

<p>The government in Boston upon Phips’s leaving had legally fallen into
the hands of that old puritan, the lieutenant-governor, William Stoughton,
and in his charge it was to remain for four years and more (November,
1694, to May 26, 1699). It was a period which betokened a future not
significant of content. It was not long before Thomas Maule could call
the ministers and magistrates hard names, and with his quick wit induce
a jury to acquit him.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> But the spirit of Parliament could not be so
easily thwarted. As colonists, they had long known what restrictive acts
the mother country could impose on their trade in the interests of the
stay-at-home merchants, who were willing to see others break the soil of
a new country, whose harvests they had no objection to reap. The Parliament
of the Commonwealth had first (1651) taken compulsory steps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and the government of the Restoration was not more sparing of the colonists.
King William’s Parliament increased the burden, and the better
to enforce observance of its laws they established a more efficient agency
of espionage than the Plantation Committee of the Privy Council had
been, by instituting a new commission in the Lords of Trade (1696), and
had followed it up by erecting a Court of Admiralty (1697) to adjudicate
upon its restrictive measures.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> About the same time (1696) they
set up Nova Scotia, which had been originally included in the Massachusetts
charter of 1691, as a royal province. The war which was waging
with France served somewhat to divert attention from these proceedings.
French privateers were hovering round the coast, and Boston was
repairing her defences.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Not a packet came into the Bay from England,
but there was alarm, and alertness continued till the vessel’s peaceful
character was established. News was coming at one time of Frontenac’s
invasion of New York, and at another of Castin’s successes at the eastward.
In August, 1696, when Captain Paxton brought word to Boston
of Chub’s surrender of Pemaquid, five hundred men were mustered, but
they reached Penobscot only to see the French sailing away, and so
returned to Boston unrewarded. The enemy also fell on the Huguenot
settlement at Oxford, Mass., and the inhabitants abandoned it.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> When
the aged Bradstreet was buried,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> they had to forego the honor they would
pay his memory in mourning guns, because of the scarcity of powder; and
good people rejoiced and shivered as word came in June of the scalping
exploit of Hannah Dustin at Haverhill, in the preceding March. In the
autumn (November 4) there was nothing in all this to prevent the substantial
loyalty of the people showing itself in a celebration of the king’s
birthday. The Boston town house was illuminated, and the governor and
council went with trumpets to Cotton Hill<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> to see the fireworks “let fly,”
as they said. No word had yet come of the end of the war, which had
been settled by the peace of Ryswick in September. A month later
(December 9, 1697) Captain Gillam arrived at Marblehead from London,
and the next day, amid the beat of drum and the blare of trumpet, between
three and four in the afternoon, the proclamation of the peace was
made in Boston. The terms of that treaty were not reassuring for New
England. A restitution of captured lands and ports on either side was
made by it; but the bounds of Acadia were not defined, and the Sagadahock
country became at once disputed ground. The French claimed
that it had been confirmed to them by the treaties of St. Germain (1632)
and Breda (1668); but the Lords of Trade urged the province to rebuild
the forts at Pemaquid, and maintain an ascendency on the spot.</p>

          <p class="pf400">This follows a contemporary engraving preserved
in Harvard College library, which is inscribed:
“His Excellencie Richard Coote. Earle
of Bellomont, Governour of New England, New
York and New Hampshire, and Vice Admirall
of those seas.” Cf. the picture of doubtful authenticity

<p>As early as August, 1695, word had come that Richard Coote, the Earl
of Bellomont, was to be the new governor of Massachusetts. Later it
was said that he would not arrive till spring; and when spring came the
choice had not even been determined upon. It was not till November,
1697, that he was commissioned governor of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts,
and New Hampshire. He landed in New York on the 2d of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
April, 1698, and on the 12th a sloop reached Boston, bringing tidings of
his arrival, and three days later the council received a communication
from him. For a year and more he stayed in New York, sending his
instructions to Stoughton, who as lieutenant-governor directed the council’s
action. On the 26th of May, 1699, the governor reached Boston;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
and it was not long before he manifested his sympathy with the party
of which Elisha Cooke was the leader. This gentleman, who was so obnoxious
to the Mather party, had been negatived by Phips, when chosen
to the council; but on Phips’s withdrawal, his election had escaped a
veto, and he now sat at the council board. Mather had succeeded, in 1697,
in forcing upon the legislature a charter, in the main of his own drafting,
which gave to Harvard College the constitution that he liked, but
he manœuvred in vain to secure his own appointment from the General
Court to proceed to England to solicit the sanction of the Privy Council;
and it was not long before he found that the new governor had vetoed
his charter, and in 1701 the assembly legislated him out of office, as the
president of the college.</p>

<p>This first blow to the dominance of the Mathers was reassuring, and
Bellomont was a leader for the new life to rally about.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> He was a man
of complacent air. He liked, if we may believe him, to hear sermons well
enough to go to King’s Chapel on Sundays, and to the meeting-house
for the Thursday lectures. He could patronize the common people with
a sufficient suavity; and when the General Court, after their set purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
voted him a present instead of a salary, if he was not much pleased,
he took his £1,000 as the best substitute he could get for the £1,200
which he preferred.</p>

<p>Boston, with its 7,000 inhabitants, was not so bad a seat of a viceroyalty,
after all, for a poor earl, who had a living to make, and was debarred the
more lucrative methods of trade. He reported back to the Lords of Trade
abundant figures of what he found to be the town’s resources and those
of his government; but the favor which he was receiving from the good
people might have been less had they known that these same reports of
his set forth his purpose to find Englishmen, rather than New Englanders,
for the offices in his gift.</p>

<p>We have also at this time the report which the scurrilous Ned Ward
made of the puritan town and its people;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> but it is not well to believe all
of his talk about the innocence of doves and the subtile wiles of serpents,
though life in Boston was not without its contrasts, as we look back upon
it now. Samuel Sewall, her first abolitionist, was even then pointing the
finger of doom to the insidious evil in his <i>Selling of Joseph</i>. Not altogether
foreign to the thoughts of many were the political possibilities of
the coming century, when on New Year’s Day, 1701, the bellman’s clangor
was heard, as he toned Sewall’s memorial verses through the streets.
There was a certain fitness in the century being ushered in, for New
England at least, by the man who was to make posterity best acquainted
with its life, and who as a circuit judge, coursing statedly the country
ways, saw more to portray than any one else. Sewall was an honest man,
if in many respects a petty one. He had figured in one of the noblest
spectacles ever seen in the self-willed puritan capital, when on a fast day,
January 14, 1697, he had stood up in the meeting-house, and had listened
with bowed head to the reading of his penitential confession for the sin
of his complicity in the witchcraft trials. Stoughton, the lieutenant-governor,
and chief justice of those trials, was quite another type of the puritan
fatalist, from whom it was futile to expect a like contrition; and when,
at a later day (December 25, 1698), Stoughton invited to dinner the
council and omitted Sewall, who was one of them, one might fancy the
cause was in no pleasant associations with the remembrance of that scene
in Parson Willard’s meeting-house. It is characteristic of Sewall that this
social slight oppressed him for fear that Bellomont, who had not yet come,
might hear of it, and count him less! But poor Sewall was a man whom
many things disturbed, whether it was that to mock him some one scattered
a pack of playing-cards in his fore-yard, or that some of the godly
chose to wear a wig!<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The smiting of the Mathers, to which reference has been made, was a
business of serious moment to those theocrats. Whoever was not in sympathy
with their protests fared badly in their mouths. “Mr. Cotton
Mather,” records Sewall (October 20, 1701), “came to Mr. Wilke’s shop,
and there talked very sharply against me, as if I had used his father worse
than a neger; spoke so loud that people in the street might hear him.”
There is about as near an approach to conscious pleasantry as we ever
find in Sewall when, writing, some days later, that he had sent Mr. Increase
Mather a haunch of very good venison, he adds, “I hope in that
I did not treat him as a negro.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mathers were praised highly and blamed sharply in their lifetime,
and have been since. There can be little dispute about what they did
and what they said; they were outspoken enough to make their motives
and feelings palpable. It is as one makes or refuses allowances for their
times that the estimate of their value to their generation is scaled. None
ever needed allowances more. They had no conception of those influences
which place men in relation to other times than their own. There
was in their minds no plane higher than the existence around them,&mdash;no
plane to which the man of all times leads his contemporaries. Matherism,
which was to them their life, was to others a domination, the long-suffering
of which, by their coevals, to us of to-day is a study. It would be unjust
to say that this mighty influence had not been often of great good; but
the gentle observer of an historic character does not contentedly witness
outbursts of selfish arrogance, canting humiliation, boastful complacency,
to say nothing of social impertinences and public indelicacies, and the
bandying of opprobrious epithets in controversy. With this there was
indeed mingled much for which New England had reason to be grateful.
Increase Mather had a convenient astuteness, which was exerted not infrequently
to her no small gain. He had learning, which usually left his
natural ability and his education free from entanglements. It was too
often quite otherwise with his son Cotton, whose reading smothered his
faculties, though he had a native power that occasionally got the upper
hand. Between them they gathered a library, which, as John Dunton
said, was the glory of New England. The awe which Increase inspired
knew little of that lurking rebellion which the too pitiful arrogance of Cotton
incited; for the father was essentially a strong and politic man, and
though his domination was waning outwardly in 1700, he had the ability
to compel the Boston press into a refusal to print the <i>Gospel Order Revised</i>,
which his opponents had written in answer to his <i>Order of the Gospel</i>,
and to force his adversaries to flee to New York to find a printer.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>The old Mather theocracy was attacked on two sides. There was, in
the first place, the defection within the old New England orthodoxy, by
which an independent spirit had established a church. From the published
manifesto of its principles this came to be known as the “Manifesto
Church,” and it had invited Benjamin Colman home from England to become
its pastor,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> who, to avoid difficulties, had been ordained in England.
He first preached in November, 1699. In the second place, the organization
of the Church of England, which had begun in Andros’s time, was
gathering strength, though Sewall got what comfort he could from the
fact that Mr. Maccarty’s shop and others were not closed on Christmas
Day. Attempts had been made to divert the funds of the Society for
the Propagation of the Gospel in New England from their application
to the needs of the Indians, to strengthen the new Episcopal movement;
and the failure to do this, as well as a spirit to emulate the missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
enterprise of the French, had instigated the formation of a new Society
in England for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts; but it was not
long before its resources were turned into channels which nurtured the
Episcopal movement and the royal authority. Strong contrasts to the
simplicity of the old order were increasing; and it was not without misgivings
that the old people had seen Benjamin Wadsworth, the new associate
pastor of the First Church, inducted (1696) into office with an
unusual formal parade. Thus the humble manners of the past were
becoming in large degree a memory; and when, a little later (June 1,
1702), the new queen was proclaimed, and the representatives were allowed
to precede the ministers in the procession, the wail in Sewall’s
diary, as well as when he notices the raising of colors at the Castle on
the Lord’s Day, betokens in another way the order of things which the
new charter was making possible.</p>

<p>While in Massachusetts the defection grew, in Connecticut the old
order was entrenching itself in the founding of Yale College, first at
Saybrook, and later at New Haven, which was destined, as Harvard declined
in the estimation of the orthodox, to become the rallying-point
of the old school.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>In Rhode Island matters went on much as the heterogeneous composition
of that colony necessarily determined. Bellomont could find little
good to report of her people, and the burden of his complaint to the
Lords of Trade touched their propensity to piracy, their evasion of the
laws of trade, and the ignorance of the officials.</p>

<p>Bellomont had returned to his government in New York when, on the
5th of March, 1701, he died. It took ten days for the news to reach Boston
(March 15), and four days later (March 19) word came by the roundabout
channel of Virginia of the declaration of war between England and
France. In the midst of the attendant apprehension, on April 7th, mourning
guns were fired for the dead governor at the Sconce and at the Castle,
and the artillery company gave three volleys in the middle of the
town, Col. Townshend, as Sewall in his antipathy does not fail to record,
wearing a wig!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>When Bellomont had left for New York in May, 1700, the immediate
charge of the government had again fallen upon Stoughton. He did not
long survive his chief, and died July 7, 1701, in his seventieth year,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and
from this time to the coming of Dudley the council acted as executive.</p>

<p>It was on Joseph Dudley, to a large party the most odious of all New
Englanders, the ally of Andros, that the thoughts of all were now turned.
It was known that he had used every opportunity to impress upon the
king his fitness to maintain the royal prerogative and protect the revenue
in New England. The people of Boston had not seen him for about ten
years. In 1691 he had landed there on his way to New York, where he
was to serve as a councillor; and during that and the following year he
had made some unobtrusive visits to his home in Roxbury, till, in 1693,
he was recalled to England to be made lieutenant-governor of the Isle
of Wight. With the death of Bellomont his hopes again rose. Ashurst,
as the senior of the Massachusetts agents, still opposed him, though his
associate, Constantine Phipps,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> was led to believe that the king might
do worse than appoint the aspirant. Dudley was not deficient in tact,
and he got some New Englanders who chanced to be in England to recommend
him; and a letter, which he used to some purpose, came not
surprisingly, considering his lineage, from Cotton Mather, saying quite
enough in Dudley’s praise. Elisha Cooke and his friends were not ignorant
of such events, and secured the appointment of Wait Winthrop as
agent to organize a fresh opposition to Dudley’s purposes. It was too
late. The letters which Dudley offered in testimony were powerful
enough to remove the king’s hesitancy, and Dudley secured his appointment,
which, on the death of the king a few days later, was promptly
confirmed by Anne.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>The news of the king’s death and the accession of the queen reached
Boston, by way of Newfoundland, on the 28th of May, 1702.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The new
monarch was at once proclaimed from the town house, and volleys of guns
and the merriment of carouse marked a new reign. How New England
was to find the change was soon sharply intimated. Amid it all tidings
came of the capture of three Salem ketches by the Cape Sable Indians.
Later in the same day the eyes of Madam Bellingham, the relict of an
early governor, were closed in death, severing one of the last links of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
other days. Her death was to most a suggestive accompaniment of the
mischance which now placed in the governor’s chair the recusant son of
Thomas Dudley, that other early governor.</p>

<p>A fortnight later (June 10, 1702), the ship “Centurion,” having Joseph
Dudley on board, put in at Marblehead, and the news quickly travelled to
Boston. The next day a committee of the council went in Captain
Croft’s pinnace to meet him, and they boarded the “Centurion” just
outside Point Alderton. Dudley received them on deck, arrayed in a very
large wig, as Sewall sorrowfully noted while making him a speech. They
saw another man whom they had not heard of, one Thomas Povey, who
was to be their lieutenant governor, and to have charge of their Castle.
They saw, too, among the passengers, George Keith, the whilom quaker,
who was come over on £200 salary, very likely paid by the Society for
the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, to convert as many as
he could to prelacy.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Sewall was not happy during that day of compliments.
The party landed at Scarlet’s Wharf amid salvos of artillery,
and under escort of the council and the town regiment they proceeded
to the town house, where the commissions were published and all “had
a large treat,” as Sewall says. Major Hobby’s coach, with six horses,
was at the door, a guard of horsemen wheeled into ranks, and so Dudley
went to that Roxbury home, whence, as many remembered, he had been
taken to be imprisoned.</p>

<p>Dudley was not deficient in confidence and forwardness; but he had no
easy task before him. He naturally inclined to the faction of which
Byfield and Leverett were leaders; but the insidious and envious Cotton
Mather, taking him into his confidence, warned him of these very people.
Dudley told them of the warning, and it was not long before the sanctimonious
Mather was calling his excellency a “wretch.”</p>

<p>When Dudley made his opening address to the General Court,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> he could
not refrain from saying some things that were not very conciliatory.
There were two points on which he raised issues, which he never succeeded
in compassing. One of these was a demand for a stated salary.
The assembly answered it with a present of £500 against the £1,000 which
they had given to Bellomont. No urgency, no threats, no picturing the
displeasure of the Crown, could effect his purpose.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The war which he
waged with the representatives never, as long as the province existed,
ended in a peace, though there was an occasional truce under pressure of
external dangers.</p>

<p>Another of Dudley’s pleas was for the rebuilding of the fort at Pemaquid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to secure possession of the disputable territory between the
Kennebec and Acadia.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The deputies were immovable. If the Crown
wished to secure that region, it must do it by other sacrifices than those
of New England.</p>

<p>Thus thwarted, Dudley could make them feel that the royal governor
had some prerogatives; and so he rejected the councillors which the
deputies accredited. All of this thrust and parry was of course duly
reported by Dudley to the home government. The situation was perplexing
in the extreme, quite as much so to the governor as to the people, who
reluctantly received him. It was for the interests of both that the war
against the French should not flag, and money was necessary, but the
governor claimed the direction of expenditures, while the representatives
stood aloof and firm on the “privilege and right of English subjects to
raise and dispose of money, according to the present exigency of affairs.”
With the clergy and the ministers, Dudley was not less unhappily placed.
His interests turned him to the church people, but they could not find that
his profession had any constancy. His lineage placed him with the Congregationalists,
and he once had the ministry in view, but his sympathies
went altogether with the new school, of which Stoddard, of Northampton,
was leader in the west, while Colman, the Leveretts, and the Brattles were
the spokesmen in Boston. In the election of a president for Harvard,
Dudley favored Leverett, the successful candidate, and made a Latin speech
at his installation,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and Cotton Mather writhed at the disappointment of
his own hopes. The governor encountered (1708), for his decisive opposition
to the Mathers, a terrible but overwrought letter from the father,
and a livelier epistle from the son. He showed in his reply a better
temper, if nothing more.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> In the opinion of all honest patriots, of whatever
party, Dudley was later found in company which raised suspicions.
The conflict with France begat, as wars do, a band of miscreants ever
ready to satisfy their avarice by trading with the enemy and furnishing
them with arms. Dudley did not escape suspicion, and he experienced
some of the bitterest abuse in talk and pamphlet,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> though the council and
the House, the latter after some hesitancy, pronounced the charges against
him a “scandalous accusation.” It can hardly be determined that he was
implicated, and Palfrey gives him the benefit of the doubt.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>The war was a fearful one. In 1703, month by month fresh tidings of
its horrors among the frontier towns reached Boston. In January it was
of Berwick, in Maine. In February came sad tidings from Haverhill. In
March there was the story of Deerfield, and how Hertel de Rouville had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
dashed upon the village. With the early summer Dudley went to Canso
to confer with the Indians (June 20); and not long after (July 8), Bombazeen,
a noted Indian, appeared in
Boston with rumors of the French
landing near Pemaquid. In August
there were sad messages from
Wells, and Capt. Southack was sent
off by sea with chaplain and surgeon.
With all this need of her
troops at home, the colony also despatched
two companies of foot to
help the British forces at Jamaica.
Samuel Sewall mourned as ever,
when on Sunday (April 23, 1704)
great guns at the Castle signalized
the Coronation-Day. “Down Sabbath!
Up St. George!” he says.
The very next day the first number
of the <i>Boston News-Letter</i> (April 24)<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
brought to the minister’s study and
to his neighbor’s keeping-room the gossip and news of the town which
was witnessing this startling proof of progress. Ten days later Dudley
signed Benjamin Church’s instructions (May 4), and the old soldier, whose
exploits in Philip’s war were not forgotten, set off by land to Piscataqua,
where he was met by Cyprian Southack in his brigantine, who carried him
to the eastern garrisons. In the <i>News-Letter</i>, people read of the tribulations
at Lancaster; of the affairs at Port Royal; of the new cannon
which Dudley got from England for the Castle; of the French captives,
whose presence in Boston so disturbed the selectmen that they petitioned
the governor to restrain the strangers, and whose imagined spiritual
needs prompted Cotton Mather to print in his tentative French his <i>Le
vrai patron des saines paroles</i>.</p>

<p>News of this sort was varied by a rumor (December 18, 1705), which
a sloop from the English Plymouth had brought, that Sir Charles Hobby
was to be made governor,&mdash;which meant that the agents of the colony in
London were trying to oust Dudley with a new man; but in this they
failed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The war made little progress. The expedition against Port Royal in
1707 was a failure, and the frontier towns were still harassed. The news
of Marlborough’s victories was inspiriting, and Boston could name a part
of its main thoroughfare after the great soldier; but while she planted
guns on her out-wharves and hoisted a tar-barrel to her beacon’s top, and
while Colonel Vetch marshalled her troops,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> she waited in vain for the
English army to arrive, in concert with which the New England forces
were to make a renewed attack on Port Royal in 1709. Rhode Island
sent her war-vessels and two hundred men, and they too lay listlessly
in Nantasket roads. Schuyler, of Albany, meanwhile started to conduct
four Mohawks or Maqua chiefs to England, where he hoped to play upon
the imagination of the queen; and in August, while the weary New Englanders
were waiting for the signal to embark, Schuyler brought the savages
to Boston, and Colonel Hobby’s regiment was mustered for their
diversion.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Very likely they were taken to see the “celebrated Cotton
Mather,” as the man who had not long before “brought in another tongue
to confess the great Saviour of the world,” as he himself said of a tract
in the language of the Iroquois, which he had printed in Boston (1707)
and supplied to the Dutch and English traders among that people. Distractions
and waiting wore away the time; but the English forces never
came, and another Port Royal attempt proved wretchedly futile.</p>

<p>That autumn (October, 1709) the New England governors met at Rehoboth,
and prepared an address to the queen urging another attempt. In
the face of these events the Massachusetts colony had to change its London
agent. Sir Henry Ashurst died, and the House would have chosen
Sir William Ashurst against Dudley’s protest, if Sir William would have
accepted. They now selected their own Jeremiah Dummer, but against
his desires.</p>

<p>The year 1710 opened with rumors from Albany about preparations
in Canada for an onset along the frontier, and it was not till July (15)
that flags and guns at the Castle and Sconce, with drum-beats throughout
the streets, told the expectant Bostonians that General Nicholson, who
was to head a new expedition, had arrived. It was candle-light before he
landed, and the letters and despatches at once busied the government. A
little later the council (July 24) entertained that commander, with Vetch
and Hobby, at the Green Dragon Tavern; and four days afterwards Governor
Saltonstall, from Connecticut, reached Boston, and the contingent
of that colony, three hundred men, was on the spot in four weeks from
the warning. In September the armament sailed,&mdash;twelve ships-of-war
and twenty-four transports, of which fourteen carried Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
troops, two New Hampshire, three Rhode Island, and five those of Connecticut.
On the 26th of October (1710), Nicholson and his force were
back in Boston, flushed with the triumph which the capitulation of Port
Royal had given them.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The town had need of some such divertissement.
There had been a scarcity of grain, and when Captain Belcher attempted
to despatch a ship laden with it the mob cut her rudder, and the excitement
had not passed without more or less inflaming of the passions. The
circle of Matherites had also disturbed the equanimity of the liberals in
theology by an anonymous document, <i>Question and Proposals</i>, which
aimed at ecclesiasticising everybody and everything,&mdash;a stroke of a dying
cause. There was an antagonist equal to the occasion in John Wise, of
Ipswich, and the Mather dynasty had less chance of revival after Wise’s
book <i>The Churches’ Quarrel Espoused</i> was launched upon the town.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Nicholson, again in England, had urged the new tory government under
Bolingbroke to make a more determined assault on Canada, and Dummer
had united with him in a petition to the queen<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> for a royal armament
to be sent for the work. Their plea was recognized and what seemed a
great force was despatched. Nicholson, with the van of the fleet, arrived
on the 6th of June, 1711,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and a convention of the New England governors
was straightway called at New London to arrange for the campaign.
The plan was for Nicholson to lead four thousand men by way
of Albany, and the Connecticut contingent of three hundred and sixty
men was to make part of this force. The royal ships came straggling
into Boston harbor. On the 24th General Hill, who brought under his
command seven of Marlborough’s veteran regiments, arrived, and the next
day Sewall and others of the council boarded the “Devonshire” and
exchanged courtesies with Hill and the admiral of the fleet, Sir Hovenden
Walker. The Boston regiments mustered and escorted them to the town
house, and the veterans were thrown into a camp on Noddle’s Island.
The next six weeks were busy ones, with preparations and entertainments.
Mr. Borland, a wealthy merchant, took Hill into his house. The governor
offered official courtesies. The transports as they came up into the
inner harbor presented a “goodly, charming prospect,” as Sewall thought.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Commencement at Cambridge came on July 4, and all the dignitaries
were there. One day some Connecticut Indians exhibited themselves before
the admiral, and on another some Mohawks danced on board the
flag-ship. By the end of the month, everything was as nearly ready as
could be,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and the fleet sailed (July 30). They went proudly away, hastened
somewhat by large desertions, which the patrolling of the roads leading
from Boston had not prevented.</p>

<p>Nicholson dallied in Boston for a
week or two, eating good dinners, and then started for New York, to take
the conduct of the land expedition, Saltonstall accompanying the Connecticut
troops as far as Albany. Much farther no one of the land forces
went, for word reached them of the sad disaster on the St. Lawrence and
of the withdrawal of Walker’s
fleet. The New England part of
it came straggling back to Boston
in October to find the town
suffering under the loss of a great
fire, which had happened on the
night of October 2-3; most unmistakably
the result, as Increase
Mather told them in a sermon,&mdash;and
perhaps believed,&mdash;of the
way in which, during the fitting
of the fleet, they had carried bundles
on the Lord’s Day, and done
other servile work! The cause
of the expedition’s failure can be
more reasonably indicated: delay
in starting, an ill-organized method
of supplies, bad pilotage, and
incompetent leaders. Walker and
Hill sailed direct for England,
and in October, while the deputies of the province were bolstering their
courage in asking the monarch for another attempt, the English mind was
being filled with charges of want of proper coöperation on the part of the
New Englanders as the all-sufficient cause of the disaster. Dummer, in
London, vindicated his people as well as he could in a <i>Letter to a Noble
Lord concerning the late expedition to Canada</i>.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>In August of the following year (1712) Bolingbroke made a truce with
France, the news of which reached Boston from Newfoundland in October
(24th). It resulted in the following spring (March 31, 1713) in the Treaty
of Utrecht, by which England acquired Acadia with its “ancient limits,”
whatever they might be, for we shall see it was a question. The news
arrived amid another corn panic. Two hundred angry and perhaps hungry
men broke open Arthur Mason’s storehouse and seized the stock of
grain. Capt. Belcher sent off another shipload, despite the remonstrance
of the selectmen; but the mob stopped short of pulling down Belcher’s
house about his ears. “Hardest fend off,” was his word.</p>

<p>Peace secured, Dudley despatched from Boston, November 6, 1713, John
Stoddard and John Williams to proceed to Albany, thence by Lake Champlain
to Quebec, to negotiate with Vaudreuil for the restoration of prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The Mason claim<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> to the province of New Hampshire had been bought
by Samuel Allen, a London merchant, and he had become its governor;
but the active ruler was his son-in-law, John Usher, who had been the
treasurer of Andros’s government, and also, as lieutenant-governor, lived
in the province. Memories of old political affiliations had not conduced
to make his relations with Sir William Phips, of the neighboring jurisdiction,
very agreeable. When Bellomont came he was commissioned to
take New Hampshire within his government; and it had fallen in the
same way to Dudley’s care. This Boston governor found himself popular
in New Hampshire, whose people had opposed the reinstatement of Usher,
though this had been accomplished in their spite. Dudley and Usher
recriminated, and told their respective grievances, and both made their
counter-charges to the home government.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Affairs went uncomfortably
enough till George Vaughan became the successor of Usher, who now
withdrew to Medford, in Massachusetts, where he died at the age of eighty,
in 1726.</p>

<p>Upon Rhode Island, Dudley had looked longingly. She would have
been brought under his commission but for the exertion of William Penn,
then her agent in London. Still, under pretence of consolidating the military
strength of the colonies as occasion might require, there was a clause
in the commission of Dudley which he construed as giving him command
of the Rhode Island militia. Dudley early (September, 1702) went
to Newport, and ordered a parade of the militia. Gov. Cranston cited their
charter as being against any such assumption of power; and the troops
were not paraded.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Dudley told the Board of Trade that the colony was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
“a receptacle of rogues and pirates;” and the people of Rhode Island
renewed their fortifications, and sent out their solitary privateer to cruise
against French and Spanish. At Dudley’s instigation the Board of Trade
(1705) prepared charges of evading the revenue against the colony.
Dudley gathered evidence to sustain them, and struggled hard to push the
wiry colony to the wall, hoping to crush her charter, and pave the way
for a general government for New England, to be the head of which he
had not a little ambition. In this Dudley had a confederate in Lord
Cornbury, now governor of New York. To him had been similarly given
by his commission the control of the Connecticut militia, but a timely
prudence saved that colony. Fitz-John Winthrop was now governor,&mdash;a
second dilution of his race, as Palfrey rather hazardously calls him,&mdash;and
blameless in purpose always. Dudley’s concert with Cornbury, aimed to
crush the charters of both Rhode Island and Connecticut, that each conspirator
might get something from the wreck to add to his jurisdiction,
utterly failed. In England Sir Henry Ashurst labored to thwart the machinations
of Dudley’s friends. In Connecticut Dudley found malcontents
who furnished him with allegations respecting the colony’s appropriating
unfairly the lands of the Mohegans,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and getting a commission appointed
to investigate he was made its president. He then proceeded in his own
fashion. He omitted to warn Connecticut of the meeting of the court,
judged the case peremptorily, and ordered the restitution of the lands.
The colony exercised its right of appeal, and prolonging the investigation
to 1743 got Dudley’s decision reversed.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Gov. Fitz-John Winthrop, of
Connecticut, died in Boston while on a visit, November 27, 1707, and was
commemorated by Cotton Mather in a funeral sermon, called in his pedantic
manner <i>Winthropi justa</i>. The vacant chair was now taken by Gurdon Saltonstall,
who did his generation great service and little harm. The policy
of Connecticut soon felt his active nature.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Her frontier towns towards
New York were guarded, and Massachusetts found she had an efficient
ally in her warfare at the eastward.</p>

<p>Connecticut, which was steadily rising above 20,000 in population in
Saltonstall’s time,&mdash;though estimates vary,&mdash;was growing more rigorous
in observance and creed in contrast to the strengthening of liberalism in
Massachusetts. Saltonstall favored the Saybrook platform, which put the
management of church affairs in a “consociation of ministers,”&mdash;a sort
of presbytery. Though a general accord in religious views linked her people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
together, she harbored some strange sectaries, like the Rogerenes of
New London, who were allied in some respects with the Seventh Day
Baptists of Westerly, just over the Rhode Island line.</p>

<p>It was during Dudley’s time that the emission of paper money had
begun to have a portentous aspect. These financial hazards and disputes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as turning people’s thoughts from old issues, had the effect to
soften some of the asperities of Dudley’s closing years of service.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> He

Massachusetts had grown much more slowly than her neighbors, and five
or six thousand of her youth had fallen in the wars. This all meant a
great burden upon the survivors, and in this struggle for existence there
was no comforting feeling for Dudley that he had helped them in their
trials. The puritan class was hardly more content. Sewall’s diary shows
the constant tribulation of his representative spirit: sorrowed at one time
by the rumor of a play in the council chamber; provoked again on the
queen’s birthday at the mocking of his efforts to check the drinking of
healths with which it was celebrated on Saturday night; and thankful, as
he confessed again, that he heard not the salutes on the Lord’s Day, which
were paid to Nicholson when he finally set sail for England.</p>

<p>It was the 15th of September (1714) when news came of the death
of Queen Anne. A sloop sent from England with orders was wrecked
on Cohasset rocks, and the government was left in ignorance for the time
being of the course which had been marked out for it. Dudley’s commission
legally expired six months after the sovereign’s demise, if nothing
should be done to prolong it. As the time came near, a committee
of the council approached him to provide for the entrance of the “Devolution
government,” as Sewall termed the executive functions, which then
under the charter devolved on the council. Dudley met the issue with
characteristic unbending; and some of his appointees knew their places
well enough to reject the council’s renewal of their commission, being
still satisfied with Dudley’s, as they professed. His son Paul besought the
ministers to pray for his father as still the chief executive, and intrigued to
prevent the proclamation of the council for a fast being read in the pulpits.
In March what purported to be a copy of an order for his reinstatement
reached Dudley by way of New York. It was quite sufficient;
and with an escort of four troops of horse clattering over Boston neck,
he hurried (March 21, 1715) to the town house, where he displayed and
proclaimed his new commission. His further lease of power, however,
was not a long one.</p>

<p>There were new times at the English court when the German George I.
ruled England; when he gave his ugly Killmansegge and Schulenberg
places among the English peeresses, and the new Countess of Darlington
and Duchess of Kendall simpered in their uncouth English. The Whig
lords must now bend their gouty knees, and set forth in poor German or
convenient&mdash;perhaps inconvenient&mdash;Latin what the interests of distant
New England required. We may well suspect that this German dullard
knew little and cared less when it was explained to him that the opposing
factions of the private and public bank in his American province of Massachusetts
Bay were each manœuvring for a governor of their stripe. We
may well wonder if he was foolish enough to read the address of the ministers
of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, or the address even of the
General Court, which came to him a little later. His advisers might have
rejoiced that Increase Mather, pleading his age, had been excused from becoming
the bearer of these messages, or of that of the ministers, at least.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>The friends of a private bank carried their point far enough to secure
to Col. Elisha Burgess the coveted commission, who, however, was better
satisfied with the thousand pounds which the friends of a public bank
were willing to pay him, and so he declined the appointment. The same
power that paid the money now got the commission issued to Col. Samuel
Shute, and the news which reached Boston (April 21, 1715) of Burgess’
appointment was swiftly followed by the tidings of Shute’s ascendency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
which meant, it was well known, that Jonathan Belcher, of Cambridge,
and Jeremiah Dummer had been successful in their diplomacy in this,
as well as in the displacing of Tailer as lieutenant-governor by William
Dummer. The latter was Dudley’s son-in-law, and the appointment gilded
the pill which the late governor was prepared to swallow.</p>

<p>The good people of Massachusetts had not long got over their thanksgiving
for the suppression of the Scottish rebellion when, just about sunset,
October 3, 1716, a gun in the harbor told of Shute’s arrival. Two days
later, at the town house, he laid his hand on the Bible, “kissing it very
industriously,” as Sewall records, and swore to do his duty. On the following
Sunday he attended King’s Chapel, and on Thursday he was present
at the usual lecture of the Congregationalists, when he heard Cotton
Mather preach.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> He seemed very docile, and doubtless smiled when
Mather’s fulsome address to him was paraded in a broadside; very docile,
too, when he yielded to Sewall’s entreaty one evening that he would not
go to a dancing-master’s ball and scandalize his name. But on November
7 (1716), in his set speech to the legislature, there were signs of trouble.
New England had peace on her frontiers, and that was not conducive to
quiet in her domestic politics. The conflict came, and Shute was hardly
equal to it. The legislature could look to a support nearly unanimous of
almost a hundred thousand people in the province, being not much short
of a quarter of the entire population of the English colonies; and a people
like the New Englanders, who could annually export £300,000 worth of
products, were not deficient at least in business courage.</p>

<p>Shute’s instructions as to the demands he should make were not novel.
It was the old story of a fixed salary, a house to live in, the command of
the Rhode Island militia, the rebuilding of Pemaquid, and the censorship
of the press. The governor brought their financial plight to the attention
of the House, and they voted more bills of credit. He told them of
other things which he and the king expected of them, and they did nothing.
So he prorogued them.</p>

<p>It was incumbent on the Crown governor to encourage the production
of naval stores, as a means of diverting attention from manufactures,
which might injure the market in the colonies for English products. One
Bridger had already made himself obnoxious, and been suspected of malfeasance
as “surveyor-general of woods,” in Dudley’s time, and it was far
from conciliatory to a people who found the Crown’s right to mast-timber
burdensome<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> that Bridger appeared in the train of Shute with a new commission.
The surveyor was arraigned by the younger Elisha Cooke, who
was now succeeding to his father’s leadership, and Shute defending him,
a rather lively contention followed, which was not quieted till Dummer,
in England, finally got Bridger removed.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> To one of Shute’s speeches the
House made a reply, and Shute threatened he would prevent their printing
it.</p>

<p>Its appearance, nevertheless, in the <i>News-Letter</i> established the
freedom of the press in Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The governor informed the
Board of Trade that the province was bound to wrest from him as much
of his representative prerogative as it could, and its action certainly
seemed sometimes to have no other purpose than to establish precedents
which might in some turn of fortune become useful. The House chose
the younger Cooke speaker in palpable defiance, and when he was disapproved
the members refused to go into another ballot, and the governor
prorogued them. When the new House assembled they contented themselves
with publishing a protest, and chose another speaker; and then
they diminished the “present” which they voted to the governor. It
seems clear that the House, in a rather undignified way, revelled in their
power, and often went beyond the limits of propriety. The charter required
that all acts should be reviewed by the Crown for approval. The
House dodged the necessity by passing resolves. Dummer in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
knew that such conduct only helped the Board of Trade to push the
plan of confederating all the provinces under a governor-general, and intimated
as much. The House was in no temper to be criticised by its
own agent, and voted to dismiss Dummer. The council in non-concurring
saved him; but the House retaliated by dropping his allowance.</p>

<p>The council was not without its troubles. Shute refused to attend
its meetings on Christmas. Sewall, ever alert at any chance of spurning
the day, “because,” as he chose to think, “the dissenters had come
a great way for their liberties,” broadly intimated that the council still
could pass its bills on that day, and the governor might take whatever
day he chose to sign them. It was certainly not a happy era in Massachusetts.
The legislature was not altogether wise or benign, and Shute
did nothing to make them so.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The frontiers, for a space, had but a hazardous peace. In August, 1717,
Shute had gone to Arrowsick (Georgetown, Me.) to hold a conference with
the Indians, and had learned from a letter received there from Sebastian
Rasle, the Jesuit missionary at Norridgewock, that any attempt to occupy
the lands beyond the Kennebec would lead to war, and as we shall see
the war came.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Meanwhile, life in Boston was full of change and shadow.
Pirates beset the people’s shipping, and when the notorious “Whidaw”
was cast away on Cape Cod (1717) they heard with some satisfaction of
the hundred dead bodies which were washed ashore from the wreck.
There was consequently one less terror for their coasters and for the paltry
sloops which were now beginning to venture out for whales from Cape
Cod and Nantucket.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> There was occasion, indeed, to foster and protect
that and all industries, for the purchasing power of their paper money was
sinking lower and lower, to the disturbance of all trade. When the province
sought to make the English manufacturers afford some slight contribution
to restoration of prosperity by imposing a duty of one per cent.
on their manufactures sent over, the bill was negatived by the king, with
threats of loss of their charter if any such device were repeated. In the
same spirit Parliament tried to suppress all iron-working in the province;<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
but after much insistence the people were allowed the boon of making
their own nails!<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Some Scotch Irish had come over in 1718, and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
most of them went to New Hampshire and introduced the potato,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> enough
remained in Boston to teach the art of linen-making. Spinning under
this prompting became a popular employment, and Boston appointed a
committee to consider the establishment of spinning schools.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Perhaps
they could spin, if they could not forge; and Boston, with her 12,000 to
15,000 inhabitants to be clothed and fed, needed to do something, if Parliament
would permit. Her spirit was not always subdued. In 1721 she
instructed her representatives not to be deterred by frown or threat from
maintaining their charter privileges. “When you come to grant allowances,”
she said, “do not forget the growing difficulties that we at this
day labor under, and that poverty is coming upon us as an armed man.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
The General Court emphasized its call for frugality by forbidding the
extravagant outlay for funerals, which was becoming the fashion.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> There
might have been some scandal at the haberdashery trade which the profuse
habits of bestowing upon their parsons gloves and rings made a possible
circumstance, to say the least, in more than one minister’s house.
But a little innocent truck in the study was not the ministers’ most pressing
diversion. Cotton, or rather Doctor Cotton Mather, as he had been
called since Glasgow, in 1712, had given him a Doctorate of Divinity,
bid for an ally against the liberals.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> When he and his father assisted in
the ordination of the new Baptist minister, Elisha Callender, in 1718; and
when Dudley, two years before his death,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> joined Sewall in open attacks
on Leverett and the government of Harvard College, there is little doubt
where the sympathy of the Mathers lay.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> They had hopes, too, that the
new Connecticut college would register their edicts, since they could no
longer enforce them at Cambridge. Sewall found the Lord’s Supper unsuggestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of charity, when the deacon offered the cup to Madam Winthrop
before it was served to him; and we, to-day, had much rather see him riding
about the country on his circuit, distributing tracts and sermons to
squires and hostlers, and astonishing the children, as he rode into the
shire-towns under the escort of the sheriff and his men.</p>

<p>But Yale College, of which so much was hoped by the lingering puritanism,
soon surprised them, when Timothy Cutler, its rector, with one
of its tutors, and other Connecticut ministers, embraced Episcopacy in
1722. Governor Saltonstall was powerless to prevent it, when at Commencement
the story of that defection was told. Cutler went to England,
received Episcopal ordination, and came to Boston in 1724 to take
charge of one of its English churches.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>But before this the care of the body as well as of souls had proved a
source of dispute with the ministers. Cotton Mather had read in the
<i>Transactions</i> of the Royal Society, to which he was sometimes a contributor
himself, of the method which was employed in Turkey of disarming
the small-pox of some of its terrors by the process of inoculation.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
That disease was now raging. While the town was moving the governor
to send the “Seahorse,” man-of-war, down to Spectacle Island, because
she had the pest among her crew, Mather urged Dr. Zabdiel Boylston to
make trial of the Turkish method. The selectmen of Boston and the town
meeting opposed it. The House forbade it by bill; but the council hesitated.
One of the most active of the physicians of Boston strenuously
objected. This was William Douglass, who had been a student of medicine
at Leyden and Paris, and who had come to Boston three years before.
Other physicians were likewise in opposition. The passions were excited
by the controversy; the press was divided; and Mather, who about this
time was finding the people “bloody and barbarous,” the town “spiteful,”
and the country “poisoned,”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> had a grenado thrown through his window.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>What with the political, financial, theological, and sanitary disturbances
of Shute’s time, and the freedom of the press, which the governor had
been foolish enough to give them the opportunity of making the most of,
the intellectual activity of the people had never before occasioned so great
a fecundity of print. The Boston man of the early part of the eighteenth
century resorted to the type-setter as readily as he gossiped, and that
was easily enough. In 1719 there were five printing-presses running in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Boston,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and the Exchange was surrounded with booksellers’ shops. The
practice of sales of books at auctions had begun in 1717 with the disposing
of the library of the Rev. Ebenezer Pemberton, or at least its catalogue
is thought to be the first of such a sale. Thomas Fleet was selling
his doggerel ballads, and the boys and girls of New England first knew
who Mother Goose was when her nursery tales were published by Fleet
in 1719. The <i>News-Letter</i> had been published for fifteen years, but not
three hundred were yet sold at an impression. Wm. Brooker, succeeding
Campbell as postmaster, felt it necessary to divide the town and give the
<i>News-Letter</i> a chance for an altercation, when in 1719 (Dec. 21) he began
the <i>Boston Gazette</i>. James Franklin had printed this paper for Brooker,
but the printing being taken from him he startled the town with the <i>New
England Courant</i>, which first appeared on Aug. 17, 1721. The new sheet
was bold and saucy,&mdash;a sort of free lance, to which people were not accustomed;
and while it gave little news and had few advertisements, its
columns swarmed with what the staid citizens called impertinences. It
wildly attacked the new inoculation theory, and elicited a public rebuke
for its scandalous conduct from Increase Mather, who was in turn attacked
by it.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>The Mathers, Elisha Cooke, Sewall, and above all Jeremiah Dummer
in his <i>Defence of the New England Charters</i>,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> published not a little of a
terse and combative strain, which the student to-day finds needful to read,
if he would understand the tides and eddies of the life of the time.
Boston was also nourishing some reputable chroniclers of her own story.
Thomas Prince, who after his graduation had gone to England, had returned
in 1717, yet to live forty years ministering to his people of the
Old South, gathering the most considerable of the early collections of
books and papers, illustrating in good part the history of New England,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
and contributing less than we could wish to such stores from his own
writing. Dr. William Douglass, as we have seen, had dipped into the
controversies of the day, practised his pen in the public journals, not
always temperately or with good taste, and thirty years later was to vent
so much prejudice in his <i>Summary of the British Settlements</i> that, though
the book is suggestive, it is an unsafe guide to the student. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Hutchinson, much the best of our colonial historians, was now a boy of
six or seven in the forms of Master Bernard’s grammar school.</p>

<p>But war was again imminent. As early as 1709 it had been considered
advisable to build a line of defences across Boston neck, and up to
1718 much money had been spent upon it. The peaceful aspect of the
affairs at that moment had been an inducement to disband the watch
which they had kept there; but in 1721 it had been again set. Gov.
Phillips, of Nova Scotia, had been in Boston to talk over the situation
at the eastward, for the warnings of Rasle rendered a continuance of
quiet doubtful. The younger Castin had been seized and taken to Boston,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
and bloodshed could hardly be averted; for though peace existed
between England and France, there was little question but the encroachments
and ravages of the Indians were instigated from Quebec. Sewall
tried to arrest the progress of events, and published his <i>Memorial relating
to the Kennebec Indians</i>,&mdash;an argument for persuasion rather than for
force. On July 25, 1722, Gov. Shute and his council declared war against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the eastern Indians, and a harrowing struggle began.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> On the 1st of
January, 1723, guns at the Castle before sunrise told the town that Shute
had sailed for England, and when the people were astir Boston Light
was sinking behind him. He went to arraign the colony in person before
the Privy Council, and never returned to his government. The conduct
of affairs, meanwhile, fell to Dummer, the lieutenant-governor, who
made Cotton Mather inexpressibly happy by what the divine called his
wise and good administration.</p>

<p>New Hampshire had been included in Shute’s commission, but Vaughan,
the lieutenant-governor, claimed that during Shute’s stay in Boston his
direct authority lapsed, and his lieutenant was the resident executive.
The strife and bickering which followed this assumption had been among
Shute’s tribulations, which were somewhat mitigated when influence at
London secured the displacement of Vaughan by John Wentworth.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The charters of Rhode Island and Connecticut did not order their enactments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to be submitted to the royal supervision, a requirement which
at one time there was danger would be made,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> but which was in good part
prevented by the ready reasoning of Dummer in his <i>Defence of the New
England Charters</i>. One act of Rhode Island, published at this time, seemingly
invalidates that colony’s claim for unfailing toleration. In the edition
of her laws printed in 1715 there is one which disfranchises Romanists.
No one is able to find beyond dispute when, in the chaotic mass of
her enactments, it became a law. To relieve the pride of her people from
any imputation so contrary to the professed purport of all her history,
Arnold, the historian of Rhode Island, has labored to show that the wording
of the statute was simply the interpretation of a committee; but it
was an interpretation that successive editors kept up till after the close
of the Revolutionary War.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In Massachusetts matters were not much improved under the rule of
Dummer. An issue soon arose. The House insisted that Walton and
Moody, commanders at the eastward, should be suspended, and refused
supplies till it was done. Dummer claimed that as commander-in-chief
he had the responsibility of such a change. He was forced, however, to
yield, and appointed Thomas Westbrooke in the place of Walton, who,
having obeyed the governor rather than the House, found he must retire
without the pay which he had earned.</p>

<p>In England Shute was presenting to the king his memorial against the
province.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> When the House heard of it they appropriated £100 to hire
counsel for the defence; but the upper branch gave the resolve a negative.
So the House sent an address to the king,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> in which the council
would not join. The House would then despatch a new agent; the council
was content with Dummer; a compromise was reached, by which
Elisha Cooke was sent to join Dummer. Shute and his opponents were
in due time heard before the Privy Council. The aspect of affairs grew
threatening. A Boston man, John Colman, wrote home that the charter
was in danger.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> It ended in the sealing of a new explanatory and supplemental
charter,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> in which Shute’s demands were fairly met, in that
there was in it an undeniable expression of the right of the governor to
reject a speaker, while the House itself was denied the right to adjourn
beyond two days. With this new order Col. Samuel Vetch had hopes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
succeeding Shute; but the old governor was not displaced. The General
Court prudently accepted the new charter, January 15, 1725.</p>

<p>While the provincial charter had been thus in jeopardy, the father of
it died. The most conspicuous of New Englanders in his day, though
his fame is somewhat overshadowed by his son’s, breathed his last, when
Increase Mather died, on August 23, 1723, at the advanced age of eighty-four.
When he was buried, a hundred and threescore scholars of Harvard
College walked in such a procession as never before attended the burial
of a New England divine. In most respects he was the greatest of a race
which was born with traits of prowess. His learning was large, far better
assimilated than that of the son, and his power over men far happier and
more consistent. His industry was enormous; he sometimes worked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
his study sixteen hours out of the twenty-four. What Cotton Mather
called the “tonitruous cogency” of his pulpit discourse was often alarming
to the timid, but not always effective for the mass. The people grew to
be disenthralled in large numbers. There was a growing belief that there
could be graces even in dogma,&mdash;a gospel that never a Mather preached.
The rude Bay Psalm Book, and the nasal cadence of the meeting-house,
were beginning to pass when the Franklins, in that obnoxious sheet the
<i>Courant</i>, were printing the hymns of Isaac Watts.</p>

<p>A year after the father died, there was a new election of president of
Harvard College. Cotton Mather was as anxious as before. The governing
board picked out in succession three Boston ministers, and never seem to
have considered Cotton Mather. Their first choice was Joseph Sewall, of
the Old South, a son of the Judge; “chosen for his piety,” as the disappointed
man sneeringly wrote in his diary. The “miserable” college, when
Sewall declined, chose the minister of the Manifesto Church, a direct thrust
at Matherism; but no choice was accepted till Benjamin Wadsworth was
elected. The college had another conflict when Timothy Cutler, after
receiving Episcopal ordination in England, came to Boston, and by virtue
of his new position as a Church of England ministrant set up his claim
to a seat in the Board of Overseers. He sought in vain. Mather meantime
was contriving to fortify himself, and determined to have a synod to
organize some resistance to this increasing antagonism. Dummer entertained
a petition to that end, but John Checkley, one of Cutler’s friends,
ferreted out the scheme, and there followed a sharp rebuke from the
lords justices, who pronounced the calling of such a body the prerogative
of the crown, and the movement came to naught. This same John
Checkley, a polemical churchman, in Boston, who kept a toy shop, united
with it the publishing of tracts, in which the prevailing theology was attacked.
In 1719 he had reprinted Charles Leslie’s <i>Short and Easy Method
with the Deists</i>, and later accompanied Cutler and his friends to England.
While there he caused another edition of Leslie to be printed
(1723), but added to it his own Boston imprint, and what was more important,
he appended a <i>Discourse concerning Episcopacy</i>, which seems to have
been a refashioning of another of Leslie’s treatises, by which Checkley had
pointedly demonstrated the schism of all ordination except an Episcopal
one. With a stock of this book he came back to Boston, and at the “Sign
of the Crown and Blue gate, over against the west end of the town house,”
he began to sell them. The magistrates found in some expressions “a
false and scandalous libel” on themselves. A trial followed with an appeal,
which dragged its slow length along; and in the midst of it Checkley delivered
a memorable speech in his own defence. It ended in his being
fined fifty pounds.</p>

<p>Checkley left Boston not long after for England; and came back again
to settle in Providence, and administer the rites of the church as he
believed they should be administered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>During all this wearisome contention in Boston, there is a glimpse of
the humaner, and perhaps more godly, spirit in the gathering of men together
under the lead of Joseph Marion to effect the insuring of neighbors’
worldly possessions from the chances of fire and the sea. It is not unlikely
that this first trial of a system which to-day contributes so much to
the sum of our happiness began then to indicate that mutual helpfulness
might conduce as much to Christian comfort as keeping eyes alert for
“scandalous libels.”</p>

<p>But there was no way yet, except by keeping other eyes alert along a
musket barrel, to meet the dangers of the frontier. When the authorities
erected (1724) Fort Dummer<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> near a spot where Brattleboro’ now stands,
they made the first English settlement in what is to-day Vermont. On the
22d of August (1724), as Sewall records, “the ‘Sheerness’ comes up and
Captain Harmon with his Neridgwack scalps, at which there is great
shouting and triumph. The Lord help us to rejoice with trembling!”
Another diary of the day makes these scalps twenty-eight, one of them
Bombazeen’s, and another that of “fryer Railes,”&mdash;and this is the shape
in which the tidings came to Boston of that quick onset at Norridgewock,
when the Jesuit Sebastian Rasle fell among his Indian neophytes, ten days
before this.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>In May of the next year, Lovewell the borderer made his last fight at
Fryeburg in Maine, and the news reached Boston on the 13th of the
same month. The ballad of Pigwacket, commemorating that bloody work,
passed into the popular memory, and abided there for many a year.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> In
the following November four eastern sagamores came to Boston, and
what is known as Dummer’s treaty was signed there on December 16,
and the next summer (August 6) it was ratified at Falmouth (Portland).
There was to be little disturbance of the peace thus consummated for a
score of years to come. The war had borne heavily on Massachusetts.
In such money as they had, it had during its four years’ continuance cost
£240,000, and when the assembly voted an issue of another £50,000 of
bills, Dummer, under royal instructions, withheld his approval. His fidelity
cost him his salary for a while, which the House refused to vote until some
compromise was reached.</p>

<p>While this quieting of the eastern frontier was in progress, the western
settlements of Massachusetts were being pushed across the mountains
beyond the Connecticut, and the peopling of Berkshire began at
Sheffield in 1725. The leading agents in this movement were Col. Jacob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Wendell, of Boston, and Col. Jonathan Stoddard, of Northampton. The
occupation proved a barrier against the Dutch of New York, though it
was sixteen years before the next settlement was made in the Housatonic
valley at Pittsfield.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>During the night of the 29th of October, 1727, New England experienced
one of the severest earthquakes which she had known. The next
morning Cotton Mather made a speech in Boston, and this, with an account
of the earthquake’s effects, was published at once as <i>The Terror
of the Lord</i>, followed shortly by his <i>Boanerges</i>, intended to strengthen
the impressions of the awful hour in the minds of the people. Haven’s
bibliography shows the affluence of the ministerial mind in the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
this event.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Sermon after sermon was published, and the press had not
ceased issuing the renewed editions of some of them when Cotton Mather
died on the 13th of February, 1728, and gave the preachers another
fruitful theme. Here was a man whose views of a fitting mundane life
were as repulsive as those of Sebastian Rasle, and whose scalp would
have aroused Quebec as Rasle’s did Boston. We have grown to judge
each by a higher standard than the prejudices and doctrines of their
time.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p class="p2">After the departure of Shute, Wentworth continued as lieutenant-governor
in the executive chair of New Hampshire. The assembly tried to
insist upon a speaker whom he disapproved, but the explanatory charter
of Massachusetts came to Wentworth’s support, and he prevailed; and
under his lead the province experienced its share of the Indian warfare.
Rhode Island remained all the time under Gov. Cranston, who had held
the office by election thirty successive years when he died in 1727. Her
chief point of contact with her neighbors was her bills of credit, which
had sunk so low that they had become little better than a pest to herself
and to the neighboring colonies. Connecticut kept her activity and quiet
ways within herself. She took no part in the war beyond putting her
border towns in a state of defence.</p>

<p class="p2">Shute was pursuing his aim in England. He had succeeded in getting
from the king an explicit threat, under whose pressure it was thought the
Massachusetts assembly would see the advisability of establishing a fixed
salary for the royal governor, when George I. died (June 11, 1727), and
Shute’s commission was vacated. He slipped into a pension of £600 a
year, and died an old man. The news of the king’s death reached Boston
in August, and on the 14th George II. was proclaimed with military parade.
The ministers beguiled themselves, as usual, preaching many sermons
on the death of a good king, and Mather Byles published a poem.</p>

<p>Since 1720 William Burnet, a son of Bishop Burnet, had been governor
of New York and New Jersey, whither he had gone to retrieve a fortune
lost in stock speculations; and with a numerous family to support, he felt
the necessity of it. The new king relieved him of some embarrassment,
occasioned by a growing unpopularity in his government, by directing his
transfer to the vacant chair of Massachusetts, signing his commission in
March. He reached Boston July 13, and as he was escorted to the Bunch
of Grapes tavern<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> the people marked his noticeable presence and his suave
manners, and might have predicted a calmer sway from him than proved
to be in store. He was flattered by his reception, and even ordered the
publication of some eulogistic verses, which Mather Byles, the clerical wit
of the time, addressed to him.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>His instructions were of the sort that
the province had got used to, though perhaps they hinted more pointedly
of the danger which awaited the charter, if the salary question was not
agreeably settled. Burnet’s speech opened the legislative war. The assembly
answered it by voting him a larger allowance than was usual,&mdash;but
still an allowance. The town of Boston had the speech read to it in
town meeting, and voted <i>nemine contradicente</i>, as we read in the records,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
in the assembly’s spirit. The House now asked to be prorogued. The
governor refused, thinking the £1,000 a month which the sitting cost might
bring them to terms. This failing, he resorted to manœuvres which even
Chalmers censures. He removed the General Court to Salem, when, in
a sort of grim irony, it recorded a resolve to legalize proceedings passed in
an unaccustomed place, and consequently unconstitutional, as they claimed.
The House now addressed a memorial to the king and refused the governor
a copy of it, and, helped by Boston merchants to pay the cost, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
representatives despatched Jonathan Belcher to coöperate with Francis
Wilks, now the resident agent in London, in obtaining the king’s favorable
attention to their plea. This appeal gave the governor a pretext for releasing
the legislature for three months,&mdash;and perhaps the device of the
House had that purpose.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade heard both sides, sustained the governor, and advised
the king to lay the facts before Parliament. The House in turn
ordered a historical summary of all the proceedings relating to the salary
question from the time of Phips to be edited and printed.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> The governor
dissolved the assembly, and took his revenge in withholding his signature
to the bill for their own pay. A new election sent to Boston an assembly
which was of the same temper. Burnet told them of the danger from
the Board of Trade’s advice to the Crown; their own agents wrote to
them there was no danger; and so the House continued as bold as ever.
The governor directed their reassembling at Cambridge. Here they
voted afresh the allowance, which was scorned as before. Meanwhile the
governor got some literary recreation, for which his acquirements well
fitted him, by printing moral and entertaining papers in the <i>New England
Journal</i>; and if this did not bring him an income, he managed to eke one
out by increasing the rate of clearance fees at the custom house, which all
went into his own pockets.</p>

<p>Returning one day from Cambridge to Boston, in August, 1729, he
was thrown into the water by the overturning of his carriage. A fever
ensued, and he died September 7. The legislature gave him an impressive
funeral, and voted £2,000 to his children; and his “character,” by
Parson Colman, was circulated in a folio half-sheet.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Dummer, as lieutenant-governor, again took the executive’s chair, and
fought over the salary question once more; and the council, as before,
steadily refused to join in the payment of the agents of the House.</p>

<p>Jonathan Belcher, lately the agent of the province, was now commissioned
governor. He came of a New England stock, and his father had
gained a fortune in trade, and had secured some political consideration as a
member of the council. His mother was a daughter of Thomas Danforth,
one of the ablest of the leading politicians under the old charter. The
new governor had graduated at Harvard College; and foreign travel had
added ease and attraction, with some of the wiles of the world, to a presentable
person. He had been accustomed to dispense his fortune in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
ways to draw attention and give him consequence. He had thrown out
intimations in high quarters in England that the view he once held on the
prerogative had undergone a change, and that he knew the turbulent
spirits of his native province well enough to manage them. Wilks and
Shute had seconded his professions, and his appointment followed. With
instructions pitched to a higher demand than ever before, he was sent
off to try his skill with an intractable people. Meanwhile Dummer had
been superseded by Tailer, a former incumbent of the lieutenant-governorship,
chiefly because the naval office he was occupying was wanted for
another. Tailer was at the time in New England, and received his commission
before Belcher arrived, which was not till August 10, 1730. So
amid the terror, from a new invasion of small-pox which had withdrawn
the town from the observance of its centenary,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and with signs
of a new life, as well as a new era, in the relief which the law was giving
to the baptists and the quakers from the burden of the parish taxes, and
with the stranger element of their population developing a new Irish Presbyterian
church under John Moorhead,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> the people of Boston received
their recusant townsman as governor. He made his speech in due time
to the General Court. Cato, he told them, went beyond reason in letting
his obstinacy lure him to destruction. This reference to the salary contention
did not intimidate them; for the House had information from its
own agents that the jealousies of the party leaders in England were not
likely to let any issue affecting the continuance of the charter be forced
upon Parliament. In any event there was a disposition rather to accept
parliamentary domination, whatever it might be, than surrender one jot
of their principles. With such a disposition the House became stubborn,&mdash;politely
so. It even voted the governor liberal grants for the services
which he had rendered as agent, and he took the gratuities though he
had abandoned the grantors. The allowances for his services as governor
he could not well accept under such instructions as bound him;
and as he needed the pay, his son solicited permission from the home
government for the father to receive the usual grants. The request was
allowed, and the salary contention came virtually to an end. When
Belcher approved a grant of £500 to be placed in the Bank of England
to the credit of the province’s agent, he little suspected he was furnishing
the means to bring about his own overthrow. His conduct of his
office rendered such an overthrow likely. The times, with all failings, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
not seen before such flagrant attempts to serve party friends with the
spoils of office. The public was so sensitive that even the younger Cooke,
accepting a judgeship with some traits of sycophancy, fell in their good
opinion.</p>

<p>The House set up a claim to audit all bills for which they granted
money, and attaching such a proviso to their grants, such votes successively
received the governor’s veto. This denied the public officers
their salaries, and occasioned distress that the home government was besought
to alleviate. The governor’s position was confirmed, and when the
news of it came the House somewhat ludicrously asked him to appoint a
day of fasting and prayer, since they were under such a “divine displeasure.”
The governor thought the matter more mundane than divine, and
refused. So in the autumn of 1733 the House saved its pride one forenoon
by passing a bill with the proviso, and in the afternoon satisfied its
sense of expediency by reversing the vote. Thus the delegates in their
ungraceful way succumbed, as the governor did two years later, respecting
the salary question. Each side was humbled, and affairs went smoothly
for a while, though the depreciation of the paper in which the governor
was paid did not quite fill the measure of his content.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Commercial distress always conduces to emotional disturbance in a community,
and the history of the “Great Awakening,” as it was called, is no
exception to the rule. This religious revival began to make itself felt in
1734, under an impulse from Jonathan Edwards,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and later, under the ministrations
of George Whitefield, the wild passion&mdash;for it became scarce
else&mdash;spread through the churches and communities of New England.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Mather Byles, Judge Danforth, and Thomas Prince supported the movement
in the <i>New England Weekly Journal</i>. Thomas Foxcroft and others, reinforced
by a large part of the country ministers, fought the battle in sermon
and pamphlet. Benjamin Colman gave the movement a qualified
commendation. It found various classes of opponents. Charles Chauncy
condemned it for its hot-bed sustenance, its “commotion in the passions,”
and its precarious growth.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Thomas Fleet, the publisher of children’s
books, turned the wit which enlivened his evening <i>vendu</i> at the Heart and
Crown, in Cornhill, into the columns of the <i>Boston Evening Post</i>, which
he had just started. Here he held up Whitefield to ridicule, just as Joseph
Green and other wits held up in the same place the pomp of Belcher to
public derision. Dr. Douglass<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> reckoned up the thousand pounds sterling
that were lost to the families of working people by what he called a misuse
of time in attending the midday mass-meetings, to which Whitefield
ministered. The passion and fervor swelled, lapsed, returned, dwindled,
and died; some counted the wrecks it left, some wondered at its transient
impressiveness, and a few occasionally struggled to revive it.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Amid all
the consternation attending what William Cooper in the election sermon
of 1740 called “an empty treasury, a defenceless country and embarrassed
trade,” New England managed to raise 1,000 men to send off to join the
fleet of Admiral Vernon in the West India waters. Scarce a hundred of
them ever returned.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

the library of the Mass. Hist. Soc., he says she was probably built between 1694 and 1696. She is considered to be the earliest man-of-war built in
the colonies. Within a short time after 1743, three vessels were built in New England for the royal navy,&mdash;the “America,” “Boston,” and “Essex.” The

<p>The social life of the chief town of New England passed on, meanwhile,
in the shadow of these ominous uncertainties. Jeremy Gridley had as
early as 1731 started <i>The Weekly Rehearsal</i>, and had given the more scholarly
classes this to ponder upon, and that to be entertained with, in columns
more purely literary than they had ever known before. If such people welcomed
the poems of Isaac Watts,&mdash;and one which Watts addressed to
Belcher was just now printed in Boston,&mdash;they caused Richard Fry, an
English printer, freshly come to Boston, to hold a high opinion of their
literary taste, because they relieved his shelves of twelve hundred copies
of the poems of Stephen Duck, the Wiltshire bard. In 1731 they listened
at a Thursday lecture to Colman’s eulogy of Thomas Hollis as a patron
of learning; and the neighboring college mourned in him the principal
benefactor of this time. Lemercier, the minister of the Huguenots in Boston,
published a Church History of Geneva (1732), which was a passing
talk. Cox, a bookseller near the town house, got out (1734) a <i>Bibliotheca
Curiosa</i>, describing his stock,&mdash;enormous for the times. Thomas Prince,
the minister of the Old South, let his antiquarian zeal bring back the
early struggles of the first settlers, when he printed (1731) the homely
<i>Memoirs</i> of Roger Clap, of Dorchester, while the century sermons of
Foxcroft in Boston (1730), and of Callender in Rhode Island (1739), made
the pews slumbrous then, and command big prices to-day. Thomas Prince,
moreover, was in travail with his <i>Chronological History of New England</i>.
He published it in 1736, and the General Court paused to take note of it,
and forgot for a moment money schemes and revivals to learn how in the
“year 1, first month, 6th day” Adam appeared, to lead the long chronology
which Prince felt bound to run down before he got to his proper theme.
He had already wearied everybody so much, when he had gone far enough
to embrace two or three years only of the New England story, that no
one longer encouraged him, and “the leading work of history published
in America up to that time” remains a fragment for the antiquaries to
regret.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>It was in the year 1741 that the Boston Cadets came into existence
as the governor’s body-guard. It was earlier, that Thomas Hancock,
who had married the daughter of Henchman, the bookseller, by whom
he was indoctrinated with the principles of successful trade, built the
stone mansion on Beacon Hill which John Hancock, his nephew, later
made more famous.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> It was in this time of commercial distress that, according
to Bennett, an observer, the reputation of the ladies of Boston
suffered if they went to a dancing-assembly lately set up; but they could
drive about with their negro footmen, and “neglect the affairs of their
families with as good a grace as the finest ladies in London.” And when
the finest lady in Boston, his Excellency’s wife, was buried in 1736, we
read of the horses of the hearse covered with broadcloth and escutcheons,
and of other parade and adornment, which gave tradespeople something
to do and money to earn. Artisans needed then more than now such
adventitious help.</p>

<p>Not a hatter might make as many hats as he would,
because he injured by so much the trade of the English hatter, and Parliament
interdicted (1732) any such rivalry. The poor man paid dear
for his molasses, because Parliament compelled the merchant to buy it
of the English sugar islands, instead of the French colonies in the West
Indies.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> He paid more for his rum, because Parliament protected the
English distillers. The merchant smuggled and had no pangs of conscience;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>

stately mansion that Thomas Hancock built.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Can we wonder that the
new country did not attract as many settlers as it might; that town rates
in Boston increased from £8,600 in 1738 to £11,000 in 1741, and the
polls fell off from 3,395 to 2,972; and that Sam. Adams, graduating at
Harvard in 1740, took for his Commencement part the inquiry, “Whether
it be lawful to resist the superior magistrates, if the Commonwealth cannot
be otherwise preserved?”</p>

<p>Belcher played the potentate with the Indians, and made his treaties
with them as his predecessors had done. He met them at Falmouth
(Portland) in 1732, and at Deerfield in 1735. Perhaps he was fairer in
his dealings with them than he was with his fellows of the whiter skin,
for he has passed into history as the least entitled to esteem of all the
line of royal governors in Massachusetts,&mdash;a depreciation perhaps helped
by his being born on the soil. His political paths were too devious.
Hutchinson tells us that when Tailer, the lieutenant-governor, died in
1732, it was Adam Winthrop that Belcher openly favored in New England
as the successor, while he intrigued with the Board of Trade to
secure the appointment of Paul Mascarene; yet to no avail, for Spencer
Phips, the adopted son of Sir William, succeeded to the place.</p>

<p>New Hampshire had been reunited with Massachusetts under Burnet,
and she had proved much more tractable than the larger colony in yielding
the point of the fixed salary to the governor. She had hopes of being
in some way rewarded for it. Under Belcher matters grew worse. He
quarrelled with the lieutenant-governor, and David Dunbar, the surveyor-general
of the king’s lands, came into the place, but without healing dissensions.
Dunbar had the
support of influential persons
like Benning Wentworth and
Theodore Atkinson; and Belcher
made what he could out
of the friendship of Richard
Waldron, the secretary.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Massachusetts, as well as her governor, had
grievances against her neighbor; and she prohibited by legislation the
circulation within her bounds of the promissory notes of New Hampshire
whose redemption was not well secured. New Hampshire and Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
were never again under a single executive. Wentworth chanced
to be in London when Belcher’s downfall came, and he readily slipped
into the executive seat of his province.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The Rhode Islanders ejected (1732) Jenckes, their governor, because
he tried to stay their wild course in the emission of paper money. The
lieutenant-governor, John Wanton, led the opponents of Jenckes, and
secured the election of his brother, William Wanton, and two years later
succeeded to the chair himself.</p>

<p>George Berkeley, in England, had been pronouncing the age barren of
every glorious theme. Perhaps to transcend this level he conceived a
project of establishing a college in Bermuda for Indians and missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
So he came over to Newport (1729) to buy American lands, and
await or perhaps force a rise on them. The death of George I. had
crossed his pious scheme by drying up his fountains. Newport was now
a thriving town of 5,000 souls, the chief town in a colony of perhaps
18,000 inhabitants. It had an Episcopal church in which Berkeley sometimes
preached, and to which he gave an organ. He had brought over
with him a Scotch artist, John Smybert, and so the patron and his
family, happy on the whole, though his glorious project had not fructified,
came out of the canvas under Smybert’s pencil; and the picture went to
Yale College, where we may see it now,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and afterwards so did his books,
and the deed conveying his Newport farm,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> when after two or three years
he had gone back to England, a disappointed man.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Not long afterwards another man with a mission ventured on a different
project in the little colony. James Franklin, who had found it prudent
to leave Massachusetts, when he told the august assembly that they did
not do all they might to catch pirates, came to this nest of free-booters,
and started a newspaper, the <i>Rhode Island Gazette</i>, the first in the colony,
and saw it fail within a year.</p>

<p>When the Spanish war was coming on, in 1739, the plucky little colony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>put herself on a war footing. She built the “Tartar,” a war-sloop of 115
tons;<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> her merchants, the Wantons, the Malbones, and others, ran five
privateers out to sea; and even her quakers found ways to help. Seven
watch-towers were built along the coast, Fort George was garrisoned,
and a battery frowned on Block Island.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The rule by which good ends sanctified base means came to its limit.
Belcher, who had not been without high support,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> was removed on the
6th of May, 1741; when he had sufficiently indoctrinated his opponents
in his own wily ways, and they had not hesitated to use them.</p>

<p>William Shirley, the governor who succeeded on the same day, was
an English barrister, who had come to Boston some time before (about
1733-35) to seek his fortune. He looked about for offices in the gift
of the home government, and began soliciting them one after another.
When the Spanish war came on, he busied himself in prompting enlistment,
and took care that the authorities in England should know it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Mrs. Shirley, then in that country, had, to her husband’s advantage as
it turned out, the ear of the Duke of Newcastle. Shirley was in Rhode
Island acting upon the boundary question, which was then raised between
Massachusetts and her neighbor, when his commission arrived, and he
hastened to Boston to take the oath.</p>

<p>Shirley had some excellent qualities for political station. He was
courtly and tactful, and when at a later day he entertained Washington
he captivated the young Virginian. He was diligent in his duties, and
knew how to retreat when he had advanced unadvisedly. He governed
his temper, and was commonly wise, though he did not possess surpassing
talents.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> In his speech to the legislature he urged the strengthening
of the defences of Boston, for the Spanish war still raged; and he
touched without greatly clarifying the financial problem. He tried in a
more civil way than his predecessor had followed to get his salary fixed;
but he could not force a vote, and a tacit understanding arising that he
should be sure annually of £1,000, he desisted from any further attempts
to solve that vexed question. A month later, he went to Commencement
at Cambridge, and delivered a Latin speech at the proper moment,
which was doubtless talked over round the punch in the chambers, as
it added one scholarly feature to a festival then somewhat riotously kept.
There was more dignity at the Boston lecture, when Benjamin Colman
preached, and when his sermon was printed it had in an appendix the
address of the Boston ministers to the new governor, and his Excellency’s
reply. Spencer Phips was retained in the chair of the lieutenant-governor,
but a new collector of Boston came in with Sir Henry Frankland,
the story of whose passion for the maid of a Marblehead inn is one
of the romances of the provincial history of New England.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Boston was now a vigorous town, and held probably for the next forty
years a larger space in the view which Europe took of the New World
than has belonged to her since. Forty topsail vessels were at this time
building in her ship-yards. She was despatching to sea twice as many
sail as New York, and Newport was far behind her. Fortunes were
relatively large, and that of John Erving, the father of Shirley’s son-in-law,
was perhaps the largest of its day. He earned a few dollars in ferrying
passengers across to Cambridge on a Commencement Day; put them
into fish for Lisbon, there into fruit for London, and the receipts into
other commodities for the return voyages, until the round of barter, abundantly
repeated, made him the rich man that he became, and one who
could give tea to his guests. The privateers of the merchants brought
royal interest on their outlay, as they captured goods from the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and Spanish traders. Yankee wit turned sometimes unpromising plunder
to a gain. One vessel brought in “a bale of papal indulgencies,” taken
from a Spanish prize. Fleet, the printer, bought them, and printed his
ballads on their backs. Another Boston merchant, of Huguenot stock,
had given the town a public hall. This benevolent but keen gentleman,
of a limping gait, did not live long to add to the fortune which he inherited.
The first use that Faneuil Hall was put to was when James
Lovell, the schoolmaster and a writer in the local magazines, delivered a
eulogy there on this same Peter Faneuil,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> while the loyal Bostonians
glanced from the speaker to the likeness of George II., which had already
been hung on its walls.</p>

<p>Shirley with the rest saw that war with France could not be far off.
There was preparation for it in the treaty with the Six Nations, which
was made at Philadelphia in July, 1742. In August Shirley himself had
treated with the eastern Indians at Fort St. George’s. The next year
(1743) the line of western settlements in Massachusetts was strengthened
by the occupation, under William Williams, of Poontoosuck, now Pittsfield,
and Williams was later instructed to establish Fort Shirley (at
Heath), Fort Pelham (at Rowe), and Fort Massachusetts (in Adams, near
the Williamstown line).</p>

<p>In 1744 the war came.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The French, getting advices from Europe
earlier, attacked Canseau before the English were aware of the hostile
decision. Though France had published her declaration in March, the
news did not reach Boston till the 2d of June. Men’s thoughts passed
from the “Great Awakening” to the stern duties of a war. “The heavenly
shower was over,” said Thomas Prince, who saw with regret what
he thought a warfare with the devil pass by; and Fleet, the wit of the
newspapers, pointed to an opportune comet, and called it “the most profitable
itinerant preacher and friendly New Light that has yet appeared
among us,” while all the pulpit orators viewed it after other and their
own fashions. Perhaps the lingering puritanism saw an omen or a warning
in the chimes just then set in the tower of Christ Church. A lottery
in full success was not heinous enough in those days, it would seem, to be
credited with all the divine rebukes that it might be now.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>There was danger on the coasts. The armed sloops of Rhode Island
and Connecticut were cruising between Martha’s Vineyard and New
Jersey, and the brigantines of Massachusetts watched the coast north of
Cape Cod.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> But the retaliatory stroke was soon to come in the expedition
against Louisbourg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Douglass, who had grown into prominence in Boston, prophesied
the failure of a scheme which had the barest majority in the assembly,
and the chances were certainly on his side: but a desire to show what
could be done without the military aid of England aroused the country,
and not a little unworthy hatred of Romanism helped on the cause. One
parson at least was ready to take along with him a hatchet to hew down
the altars of the papist churches. A company from Plymouth, under Sylvanus
Cobb, was the earliest to reach Boston. Massachusetts mustered
3,250 men, and the transports which sailed out of Boston harbor with
this force made a fleet of a hundred sail, under convoy of nine or ten
armed vessels, the whole carrying not far from 200 cannon.</p>

<p>The reader must turn to another chapter for the progress of the siege.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
Good fortune favored this time the bold as well as the brave. Word
coming back to Boston for reinforcements, an express was sent to Captain
Williams, at Fort Shirley, and in six days he reported in Boston with
74 men, and sailed on the 23d of June. Louisbourg, however, had already
surrendered (June 16), two days after the Rhode Island sloop “Tartar”<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
and two other war-sloops had dispersed the flotilla which was speeding
from Annapolis to its assistance. This was the only active force of Rhode
Islanders in the campaign; her contingent of foot, which was intended
to join the Connecticut regiment, did not reach the ground till after the
surrender; but her privateers did good service elsewhere, meanwhile,
having sent into Newport during the year a full score of prizes.</p>

<p>It was on a fast day, July 2d, that the news of the success reached
Boston, and spread throughout the colonies, occasioning<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> exuberant rejoicing,
which the ministers tempered as best they could with ascribing
the conquest to the finger of God, shown “more clearly, perhaps,” as
Charles Chauncy said, “than since the days of Joshua and the Judges.”
Modern historians think that Douglass was right, and that extraordinary
good luck was a chief reason of the success.</p>

<p>The colonies beyond the Hudson were now anxious to be partakers in
the cost and in the burden of the future defence of the captured fortress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
if they had not shared the danger and exhaustion of the victory.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Pennsylvania
offered £4,000, New Jersey £2,000, and New York £3,000.</p>

<p class="p2">The victorious Pepperrell returned to Boston in June, 1746. Cannon
from the batteries saluted the frigate which brought him. The governor
welcomed him at the Castle and escorted him to the landing of the town,
where the Cadets received him and led the way to the council chamber.
Here addresses and congratulations were exchanged, and the successful
general started for his home in Maine, meeting demonstrations of honor
at every town on his way.</p>

<p>Shirley now resolved on further conquest, and plans were being arranged
for an armament sufficient for the conquest of all New France, with the
help this time of veterans from England, when news came of the speedy
arrival of a large French fleet on the coast, with a mission of reprisals
and devastation.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> In August a thanksgiving for the victory at Culloden
was held, and Thomas Prince spoke in the Old South in Boston. In
September there was little giving of thanks, and there was much fear of
the French admiral, D’Anville. Troops were pouring into Boston from
the country. Douglass says he saw six or seven thousand of them on
Boston Common. The defences of the harbor were being rapidly
strengthened. All the coast lookouts were reëstablished, and shore batteries
were manned. Rhode Island pushed work on her forts. Connecticut
sent promises of large reinforcements, if the attack should fall
on Boston. Every Frenchman was put under surveillance, and the times
inciting to strong language, the General Court issued orders for greater
publicity to be given to the act against profaneness. There was a fast to
supplicate for mercy. Thomas Prince in his pulpit heard the windows
of the meeting-house rattle with a rising storm. He prayed that it might
destroy the French fleet. It did. Divided counsels, disappointments in
plans, the sudden death of D’Anville, its commander, the suicide of his
lieutenant, disorganized the purpose of the enemy; the waves and the
rocks did the rest, and only a fragment of the great armament went
staggering back to France. Boston breathed easily, and the hasty soldiers
marched home to their harvests; and when news came of the
compact which George Clinton had made with the Six Nations at Albany,
in August and September, hope and courage prevailed, though the tidings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
from Fort Massachusetts were distressing. Then came other massacres,
and Indians were reported prowling through northern Hampshire. It had
been intended to make a demonstration against Crown Point in the autumn.
Provisions and munitions were hurried from Boston; Massachusetts
men gathered at Albany. Winter came, disconcerting plans, and
discouragement ensued.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>The next year Boston had a taste of the old-world despotism to which
it had not been accustomed. Commodore Knowles, commanding a part
of the fleet which had assisted in the capture of Louisbourg, came to Boston.
Some of Knowles’ men deserted, and as enlistments did not bring
what recruits the fleet needed, the commodore sent a press-gang to town
(November 17, 1747), which seized whomever they found about the
wharves. Boston was enraged. A mob gathered, and demanded that
some of the officers of the fleet, who were in town, should be detained as
hostages. The air grew murkier, and Shirley became frightened and fled
to the Castle. The legislature tried to settle the difficulty, and Knowles
threatened to bombard the town, unless his officers were released. The
General Court denounced the riot, but signified to the commodore the
necessity of redress. Under its order, the officers returned to the fleet,
and Knowles, finding the business had become dangerous, let most if not
all of his recruits go, and set sail, but not till the governor, gathering courage
from the control over the mob which a town meeting had seemed to
acquire, had come back to town, when he was escorted to his house by the
same militia that had refused his summons before.</p>

<p>It was a violent reaction for Shirley from the enthusiasm of the Louisbourg
victory, thus to experience the fickleness of what he called the
“mobbishness” of the people; and his trust in the town meeting and the
assembly was not strengthened when the representatives reduced his
allowance, on pretence of the burdens which the war had brought. Shirley
intimated that the 200,000 population of the province and a capital with
20,000 inhabitants did not mark a people incompetent to pay their rulers
equably; but his intimations went for little. The colony was not in very
good humor. England, in making the treaty of Aix la Chapelle (October
7, 1748), had agreed to restore Louisbourg to the French, and leave the
bounds as before the war. There were discordant opinions among the
advisers of the government touching the real value of Louisbourg as a
military post; but it was unfortunate that to redress the balance in Europe
England had to relinquish the conquests of her colonists. It may
not have been wholly without regard to the quelling of the New England
pride, which might become dangerous,&mdash;since Sam. Adams was pluming
his political rhetoric in the <i>Independent Advertiser</i> at this time,&mdash;that it
was thought best by that treaty to give to the province an intimation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the superior authority of the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The province was not without its
own power of warning, for Hugh Orr, a young Scotchman, manufactured
about this time at Bridgewater 500 stands of arms for the province of
Massachusetts Bay; which are said to have been carried off by the British
from Castle William when they evacuated Boston in March, 1776. They
are supposed to have been the first made in America.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Horatio Walpole, the auditor-general, with an eye to his own
personal advantage, had brought forward a project of the Board of Trade
for overruling the charters of the colonies; but the strenuous opposition
of William Bollan and Eliakim Palmer for Massachusetts and Connecticut
made the advocates of the measure waver, and the movement failed.
Shirley was devising a plan of his own, which looked to such an extension of
the parliamentary prerogative as had not yet been attempted. His scheme
was to build and maintain a line of posts at the eastward, the expense of
which all the colonies should share under a tax laid by Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> In the
pursuit of this plan, Shirley obtained leave of absence, and went to England
(1749), while the conduct of affairs was left in the hands of Spencer
Phips, the lieutenant-governor, a man of experience and good intentions,
but not of signal ability. Thomas Hutchinson, James Otis, and two others
meanwhile went to Falmouth to engage the eastern Indians, who were far
from quiet, in a treaty, which was finally brought to a conclusion on October
16, 1749. In the following winter (1749-50), Sylvanus Cobb was in
Boston fitting out his sloop for a hostile raid through the Bay of Fundy;
but Cornwallis at Halifax thought the preparations for it had become
known to the French, and the raid was not accomplished.</p>

<p>The next year (1750), Parliament touched the provinces roughly. The
English tanners wished for bark, and they could get it cheap if the English
land-owners could sell their wood to the furnaces, and the furnaces
would buy it if they could find a sufficient market for their iron and steel,
as they could do if they had no rivals in America. It was a chain of possibilities
that Parliament undertook to make realities, and so passed an act
forbidding the running of slitting and rolling mills in the colonies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Charles Townshend, who introduced the bill, found no opposer in Shirley.
The bold utterances that Jonathan Mayhew was making in indignant
Boston carried a meaning that did not warn, as it might, the Board of
Trade in England.</p>

<p>Shirley, after four years’ absence, during which he had been employed in
an unsuccessful mission to Paris about the Acadian boundaries, came back
to Boston in 1753, to be kindly received, but to feel in bringing with him
a young Catholic wife, whom he had married in Paris, the daughter of
his landlord, that he gave her the position of the first lady in the province
not without environing himself and her with great embarrassment, in a
community which, though it had departed widely from the puritanism of
the fathers, was still intolerant of much that makes man urbane and
merry. While Shirley had been gone, the good town had been much
exercised over an attempt to introduce the drama, and the performance of
Otway’s <i>Orphan</i> at a coffee-house in King Street had stirred the legislature
to pass a law against stage plays. The journals of Goelet<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> and
others give us some glimpses of life, however, far from prudish, and
show that human nature was not altogether suppressed, nor all of the
good people quite as stiff as Blackburn was now painting them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his hymeneal entanglement, Shirley was unquestionably
the most powerful Englishman at this time in America. The fortuitous
success of his Louisbourg expedition had given him a factitious
military reputation.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> A test of it seemed imminent. For the sixth time
in eighty years the frontiers were now ravaged by the savages. Pepperrell
was sent to pacify the eastern Indians. The French were stretching
a cordon of posts from the Atlantic to the gulf which alarmed Shirley,
and he doubted if anything was safe to the eastward beyond the
Merrimac, unless the French could be pushed back from Nova Scotia.
He feared New Hampshire would be lost, and with it the supply of
masts for the royal navy. A road had been cut along the Westfield
River through Poontoosuck (Pittsfield) to Albany, and Shirley planned
defences among the Berkshire Hills.</p>

<p>At this juncture a conference of the colonies was called at Albany
in 1754, which had been commanded through the governor of New York
by the Board of Trade. The reader will find its history traced on a
later page. Hutchinson in July brought back to Boston a draft of the
plan of action. In the autumn the legislature was considering the question,
while Franklin was in Boston (October-December) conferring with
Shirley and discussing plans. Boston held a town meeting and denounced
the Albany plan, and in December (14th) the legislature definitely
rejected it, as all the other colonies in due time did. Rhode Island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
particularly, was very vigilant, lest an attempt might be made to abridge
her charter-privileges. Connecticut established its first press in this very
year, which with the press of the other colonies, was lukewarm or hostile
to the plan.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Shirley had not attended the congress. He had left Boston in June
(1754) on the province frigate “Massachusetts,” with the forces under
John Winslow to build a fort on the Kennebec, which was completed on
the 3d of September and called Fort Halifax. On his way he stopped at
Falmouth, and on the 28th of June he had a conference with the Norridgewock
Indians, and on July 5th another with the Penobscots. Accompanied
by some young Indians who were entrusted to the English
for education, the governor was once more in Boston on the 9th of September,
where he was received with due honor.</p>

<p>This expedition and the congress were but the prelude to eventful
years. When Henry Pelham died, on the 6th of March of this year,
his king, in remembrance of the wise and peaceful policy of his minister,
exclaimed, “Now I shall have no more peace!” For the struggle which
was impending, New England had grown in strength and preparation,
and had had much inuring to the trials of predatory warfare. She had
increased about sixfold in population, while New York and Virginia had
increased fivefold. The newer colonies of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New
Jersey, and Maryland had fairly outstripped these older ones, and numbered
now nine times as large a population as they had sixty-five years
earlier. The Carolinas and Georgia had increased in a ratio far more
rapid. Massachusetts at this time probably had 45,000 on its alarm list,
and in train-bands over 30,000 stood ready for the call.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> John Adams,
when teaching a school in Worcester the next year, ventured to write to
a friend, “If we can remove the turbulent Gallicks, our people will in
another century become more numerous than England itself.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1755 Shirley went to Alexandria, in Virginia, being
on the way from March 30 till April 12, to meet the other governors,
and to confer with General Braddock upon the organization of that general’s
disastrous campaign. When the news of its fatal ending reached
New England it gave new fervor to the attempts, in which she was
participating, of attacking the French on the Canada side,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
seemed brought nearer home to her people when, by the death of Braddock,
the supreme command devolved on the Massachusetts governor.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
On the 6th of November, at Thomas Hutchinson’s instigation and in
expression of their good-will at Shirley’s promotion, the General Court
passed a vote of congratulation.</p>

<p>The autumn had been one of excitement in Boston.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The forces of
nature were conspiring to add to the wonderment of the hour. A part of
the same series of convulsions which overturned Lisbon on November 1st
and buried Sir Henry Frankland in the ruins, to be extricated by that
Agnes Surriage whose romantic story has already been referred to, had
been experienced in New England at four o’clock in the morning of the
18th of the same month, with a foreboding of a greater danger; but the
commotion failed in the end to do great damage to its principal town,
then esteemed, if we may believe the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, finer than any
town in England excepting London. People looked to the leading man
of science in New England of that time for some exposition of this mighty
power, and Prof. John Winthrop gave at Cambridge his famous lecture on
earthquakes, which was shortly printed.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The electrical forces of nature
had not long before revealed themselves to Franklin with his kite, and
it was in November or December that the news was exciting comment
in Boston, turning men’s thoughts from the weariness of the war.</p>

<p>That war had not prospered under Shirley, and with a suspicion that
he had been pushed beyond his military capacity he was recalled to England,
ostensibly to give advice on its further conduct. He had found
that Massachusetts could not be led to tax herself directly for the money
which he needed, and only pledged herself to reimburse, if required, the
king’s military chest for £35,000, which Shirley drew from it. A scale
of bounties had failed to induce much activity in enlistments, and the
forces necessary for the coming campaign were gathering but slowly.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
This was the condition of affairs when Shirley left for England, carrying
with him the consoling commendations of the General Court.</p>

<p>Spencer Phips, the lieutenant-governor, succeeded to the executive chair
in Massachusetts at a time when even Boston was not felt to be secure,
so fortunate or skilful were the weaker French in a purpose that was not
imperilled by the jealousies which misguided the stronger English. It
was now problematical if Loudon, the new commander-in-chief, was to
bring better auguries. In January of the next year (1757), he came to
Boston to confer with the New England governors. The New England
colonies now agreed to raise 4,000 new troops. Meanwhile Phips had died
in April (4th) in the midst of the war preparations, and Pepperrell, as
president of the council, next directed affairs till Thomas Pownall,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> who
had been commissioned governor, and who had reached Halifax on the
fleet which brought Lord Howe’s troops, arrived in Boston, August 3d,
on the very day when Montcalm on Lake George was laying siege to
Fort William Henry, which in a few days surrendered. The news did
not reach Pownall till he had pushed forward troops to Springfield on
their way to relieve the fort. He put Pepperrell at once in command of
the militia,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and a large body of armed men gathered under him on the
line of the Connecticut;<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> for there was ignorance at the time of Montcalm’s
inability to advance because of desertions, and of the weakening
of his force by reason of the details he had made to guard and transport
the captured stores. Messengers were hurried to the other colonies to
arouse them. John Adams, then a young man teaching in Worcester,
kept from the pulpit by reason of his disbelief in Calvinism, stirred by
the times, with the hope some day of commanding a troop of horse or
a company of foot, was one of these messengers sent to Rhode Island,
and he tells us how struck he was with the gayety and social aspect of
Sunday in that colony, compared with the staid routine which characterized
the day in Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>Massachusetts had enrolled 7,000 men for the campaign. Connecticut
had put 5,000 in the field, and Rhode Island and New Hampshire a regiment
each. Massachusetts had further maintained a guard of 600 men
along her frontiers. The cost of all these preparations necessitated a tax
of half the income of personal and landed property.</p>

<p>In a commercial sense almost crushed,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> in a political sense the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
were as buoyant as ever. When Loudon sent orders to quarter a regiment
of the British troops on the people, the legislature forbade it, and
grew defiant, and nothing could pacify them but the withdrawal of the
order. The commander-in-chief, however he stormed in New York, found
it expedient to yield when he learned of the fury his order was exciting in
a colony upon whose vigor the home government was largely depending for
the successful prosecution of the war. This had now fallen into the hands
of Pitt, and he at once recalled Loudon, who chanced to be in Boston, parleying
with the legislature about raising troops, when an express brought
him his recall. Abercrombie, who succeeded, was even a worse failure;
but there was a burst of light at the eastward. Amherst had captured
Louisbourg in July (1758),<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and bringing his troops by water to Boston had
landed them on September 13. Never was there so brilliant array of war
seen in the harbor as the war-ships presented, or on Boston Common
where the troops were encamped. Amherst delayed but three days for
rest, when on the 16th of September he began his march westward to
join the humbled Abercrombie. At Worcester the troops halted, and
John Adams tells us of the “excellent order and discipline” which they
presented, and of the picturesqueness of the Scotch in their plaids, as this
army of four thousand men filled his ardent gaze.</p>

<p>During the winter recruiting was going on in Boston with success for
the fleet wintering at Louisbourg.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> In the campaign of the next year (1759),
Massachusetts and Connecticut put at least a sixth of all their males able
to bear arms into the field. They were in part in the army which Amherst
led by way of Lake Champlain to the St. Lawrence, and among them
were some of the veterans which Pepperrell had command in 1745 at Louisbourg,&mdash;Pepperrell
who was to die during the progress of the campaign,
on the 6th of July, at Kittery in his sixty-fourth year. Another portion
went with Pownall to the Penobscot region, or followed him there, and
assisted in the building of Fort Pownall, which was completed in July
(1759).<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The reader must turn to another chapter<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> for the brilliant success
of Wolfe at Quebec, which virtually ended the war.</p>

<p>George the Second hardly heard of the victories which crowned his
minister’s policy. He died October 25, 1760, but the news of his death
did not reach Boston till December 27th. He had already effected a
change in the government of Massachusetts. Pownall, who had made interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
with the Board of Trade to be transferred to the executive chair of
South Carolina, left Boston in June, taking with him the good wishes of a
people whom he had governed more liberally and considerately than any
other of the royal governors.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Two months later (August 2, 1760), Francis
Bernard, who had been governor of New Jersey,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> reached Boston as his
successor. He showed some want of tact in his first speech, in emphasizing
the advantages of subjection to the home government, and gave the
House opportunity to rejoin that but for the sacrifice in blood and expense
which these grateful colonies had experienced, Great Britain might now
have had no colonies to defend. Notwithstanding so untoward a beginning,
Bernard seems to have thought well of the people, and reported fair
phrases of encomium to the Lords of Trade.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>A few weeks after Bernard’s arrival Stephen Sewall, the chief justice,
died (September 11, 1760). Thomas Hutchinson was now the most conspicuous
man in New England, and he had put all New England under obligations
by his strenuous and successful efforts to better their monetary
condition. A train of events followed, which might possibly have been
averted, if, instead of appointing Hutchinson to the chief-justiceship, as he
did, Bernard had raised one of the other justices, and filled the vacancy
with Col. James Otis, then Speaker of the House, father of the better
known patriot of that name, and whose appointment had been contemplated,
it is said, by Shirley. Hutchinson was already lieutenant-governor,
succeeding Spencer Phips, and was soon to be judge of probate also
for Suffolk,&mdash;a commingling of official power that could but incite remark.</p>

<p>The younger Otis was soon to become conspicuous, in a way that might
impress even Bernard. There were certain moneys forfeited to the king
for the colony’s use, arising from convictions for smuggling under the
Sugar Act; the province had never applied for them, and had neglected
its opportunities in that respect. The House instructed Otis to sue the
custom-house officers. The superior bench under the lead of Hutchinson
decided against the province, and it did not pass without suspicion
that Bernard had placed Hutchinson on that bench to secure this verdict.</p>

<p>An event still more powerful in inciting discontent was approaching.
Charles Paxton, who had been surveyor of Boston since 1752, had, in his
seeking for smuggled goods, used general search warrants,&mdash;unreturnable,
known as “writs of assistance,” and of course liable to great abuse.
It seems probable that this process had been so far sparingly used, and
there had been no manifest discontent. Upon the king’s death, the existing
writs had only a six months’ later continuance, when new applications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
must be made under the new reign. These new applications came
at a time when the public mind was much exercised, and there was a
determination to question the legality of such unrestrained power as the
writs implied. The hearing was to be before the court of which Hutchinson
was now the chief. Jeremy Gridley appeared for the king, and the
younger Otis with Oxenbridge Thacher for the petitioners. The court
deferred its decision, but in November, 1761, the case was again discussed.
The court meanwhile had had advices from England, and the writs were
sustained. In the discontent growing out of this proceeding, we may find
the immediate beginning of the controversy between the provinces and the
Crown, which resulted in the American Revolution. The subsidence of
the war left men time to think deeply of these intestine griefs, and when
the Peace of Paris in February, 1763, finally dissipated the danger of arms,
events had gone far to shape themselves for bringing another renewal of
battle, not with the French, but with the mother country.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid"><a name="c156" id="c156">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap04"><span class="smcap">NEW England in general.</span>&mdash;Of Cotton Mather’s <i>Magnalia Christi Americana, or
the Ecclesiastical History of New England from 1620 to 1698</i>, mention has been
made in another volume,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and, as the title shows, it touches only the few earlier years of
the period now under consideration. The book was published in London in 1702, and a
solitary forerunner of the edition reached Boston, as we know, October 29 of the same year.
It was the most considerable work which had been produced in the British colonies, and
was in large part an unshapely conglomerate of previous tracts and treatises. Neal,
Mather’s successor in the field, while praising his diligence in amassing the material of
history, expressed the opinion of all who would divest scholarship of meretriciousness
when he criticised its “puns and jingles,”<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> and said, “Had the doctor put his materials
a little closer together, and disposed them in another method, his work would have been
more acceptable.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> But Mather without Matherism would lose in his peculiar literary
flavor; we laugh and despise, while his books nevertheless find a chief place on the
shelves of our New England library. Mather was still young when the <i>Magnalia</i> was
printed, but he stood by his methods and manner a quarter of a century later, and in publishing
(1726) his <i>Manuductio ad Ministerium</i><a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> he defended his labored and bedizened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
style against, as he says, the blades of the clubs and coffee-houses, who set up for critics.
He also belabored Oldmixon in a similar fashion, when that compiler both borrowed the
doctor’s labors and berated his reputation, and Mather called him, in his inveterate manner,
Old Nick’s son.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Sibley not unfairly remarks that these peculiarities of Mather’s
style were probably almost as absurd to his contemporaries as to ourselves;<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> and very
likely it helped to create something of that curiosity respecting him, which Prince tells
us he found in Europe at a later day.</p>

<p>In any estimate of Cotton Mather we may pass by the eulogy of his colleague Joshua
Gee,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and the <i>Life of Cotton Mather</i><a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> by his son Samuel, as the efforts of a predisposing
and uncritical friendliness. We are not quite sure how far removed from the fulsome
flattery, if not insincerity, of funeral sermons in those days was the good word upon his
contemporary which came from Benjamin Colman.</p>

<p>With the coming of the present century we might suppose the last personal resentment
of those who knew Cotton Mather had gone, and as an historical character it might well
be claimed that a dispassionate judgment was due to him. When James Savage edited
Winthrop’s journal, the public were told how Cotton Mather should be contemned; and
the tale was not untruthful, but it was one-sided. Quincy in his <i>History of Harvard
University</i> could give no very laudatory estimate of the chronic and envious grumbler
against the college.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> When Dr. Chandler Robbins wrote the <i>History of the Second
Church</i> of Boston, he said all he could, and in a kindly spirit, to qualify the derogatory
estimate then prevalent respecting his predecessor; and W. B. O. Peabody in his <i>Life of
Cotton Mather</i><a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> tempered his judgment by saying, “There is danger lest in our disgust
at his fanaticism and occasional folly we should deny him the credit which he actually
deserves.” His professed defenders, too, lighten their approval with pointing out his
defects. Thus does Samuel G. Drake in a rather feeble memoir in the <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i> (vol. vi.), and in the 1855 edition of the <i>Magnalia</i>. Dr. A. H. Quint in the
<i>Congregational Quarterly</i>, 1859, and Dr. Henry M. Dexter in the <i>Memorial Hist. of
Boston</i>, vol. ii., incline to the eulogistic side, but with some reservations. Mr. Samuel F.
Haven in the <i>Report of the Amer. Antiq. Soc.</i>, April, 1874, turned away the current of
defamation which every revival of the Salem witchcraft question seems to guide against
the young minister of that day. The estimates of Moses Coit Tyler in his <i>Hist. of
Amer. Literature</i> (vol. ii.), and John Langdon Sibley in his <i>Harvard Graduates</i> (vol.
iii.), show that the disgust, so sweeping fifty years ago, is still recognized amid all efforts
to judge Mather lightly.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Mankind is tender in its judgment of the average man, when a
difference of times exists. The historical sense, however, is rigid in its scrutiny of those
who posture as index-fingers to their contemporaries; and it holds such men accountable
to the judgments of all time. Great men separate the perennial and sweet in the traits
of their epoch from the temporary and base,&mdash;a function Cotton Mather had no conception
of.</p>

<p class="p2">The next general account of the New England colonies after the <i>Magnalia</i>, and covering
the first thirty years of the present period, was Daniel Neal’s <i>History of New-England
containing an account of the civil and ecclesiastical affairs of the country to 1700</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
<i>With a map, and an appendix containing their present charter, their ecclesiastical discipline,
and their municipal-laws</i>. In 2 vols. (London. 1720.)<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Watts, writing to Cotton Mather, Feb., 1719-20, of Neal’s history, said that he had
hoped to find it “an abstract of the lives and spiritual experiences of those great and
good souls that planted and promoted the gospel among you, and those most remarkable
providences, deliverances, and answers to prayers that are recorded in your <i>Magnalia
Christi</i>, but I am disappointed of my expectations; for he has written with a different
view, and has taken merely the task of an historian upon him.” Watts took Neal to task
personally for his freedom about the early persecution; but Neal only answered that the
fidelity of an historian required it of him.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Neal himself in his preface (p. iv.) acknowledges
his freedom in treating of the mistakes into which the government fell.</p>

<p>Prince in the preface to his <i>Chronological History of New England</i> says: “In 1720
came out Mr. Neal’s History of New England.... He has fallen into many mistakes of
facts which are commonly known among us, some of which he seems to derive from Mr.
Oldmixon’s account of New England in his British Empire in America, and which mistakes<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
are no doubt the reason why Mr. Neal’s history is not more generally read among
us; yet, considering the materials this worthy writer was confined to, and that he was
never here, it seems to me scarce possible that any under his disadvantages should form a
better. In comparing him with the authors from whence he draws, I am surprised to see
the pains he has taken to put the materials into such a regular order; and to me it seems
as if many parts of his work cannot be mended.”</p>

<p class="p2">Rogers and Fowle, printers in Boston, who were publishing a new magazine, begun in
1743, called <i>The American Magazine</i>, announced that they would print in it by instalment
a new history of the English colonies. They changed the plan subsequently so as to
issue the book in larger type, in quarterly numbers, and in this form there appeared in
January, 1747, the first number, with a temporary title, which read: <i>A summary, historical
and political, of the first planting, progressive improvements and present state of the
British settlements in North America; with some transient accounts of the bordering
French and Spanish settlements. By W. D., M. D., No. 1. To be continued</i>. Boston,
1747.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The author soon became known as Dr. William Douglass, the Scotch physician
living in Boston,&mdash;“honest and downright Dr. Douglass,” as Adam Smith later chose
to call him. He had drawn (pp. 235-38), in contrast to Admiral Warren, a severe character
of Admiral Knowles, whose conduct, which occasioned the impressment riot then
recent, was fresh in memory. Knowles seems to have instituted a suit for libel, which
led to a rather strained amend by Douglass in the preface to the first volume, when the
numbers were collected in 1749, and were issued with a title much the same as before, <i>A
Summary, historical and political, of the first planting,</i> etc., <i>containing</i>&mdash;here follow five
heads.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The character which he had given of Knowles, he says, was written out of passionate
warmth and indiscretion, merely “in affection to Boston and the country of New
England, his <i>altera patria</i>,” and then adds that he has suppressed it in the completed
volume.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The second volume is dated 1751, and Douglass died in 1752.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>To his second volume (1751) he adds what he calls “a supplement to the first volume
and introduction to the second volume,” in which he hints at the offence he had given
Shirley and Knowles&mdash;the latter’s suit for libel forcing him to recant, as we have seen&mdash;by
saying, “If facts related in truth offend any governor, commodore, or other great
officer,” the author “will not renounce impartiality and become sycophant.” He further
charges upon “the great man of the province for the time being,” as he calls Shirley,
the “impeding, or rather defeating, this public-spirited, laborious undertaking,” as he
characterizes his own book.</p>

<p>A large part of the work is given to New England, which he knew best; but his knowledge
was at all times subservient to his prejudices, which were rarely weak. He is often
amusing in his self-sufficiency, and not unentertaining; but he who consults the book is
puzzled with his digressions and with his disorderly arrangement, and there is no index to
relieve him.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Hutchinson struck the estimate which has not since been disputed: it was
his “foible to speak well or ill of men very much as he had a personal friendship for them,
or had a personal difference with them.”<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Prof. Tyler in his <i>Hist. of American Literature</i><a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
has drawn his character more elaborately than others.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> His book, while containing
much that is useful to the student, remains a source of uncertainty in respect to all statements
not elsewhere confirmed, and yet of his predecessors on New England history
Douglass has the boldness to say that they are “beyond all excuse intolerably erroneous.”<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>A wider interest than that of ecclesiastical record attaches to a book which all students
of New England history have united in thinking valuable. This is the work of Isaac
Backus, a Baptist minister in Middleborough, Mass., who published at Boston in 1777 a
first volume, which was called <i>A History of New England, with particular reference to
the denomination of Christians called Baptists</i>.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> This volume brought the story down to
1690 only, but an appendix summarized subsequent history down to the date of the book.
In the second volume, which appeared at Providence in 1784, the title was changed to <i>A
Church History of New England, vol. ii., extending from 1690 to 1784</i>. The same title
was preserved in the third volume, which was published in Boston in 1796, bringing the
narrative down to that date. In the preface to this volume the author complained of the
many typographical errors in the first volume, and professed that though there had been
private dislikes of the work by some “because their own schemes of power and gain
were exposed thereby,” he knew not of any public dispute about “its truth of facts.”
The whole work has been reprinted under the title of the original first volume, with
notes by David Weston, and published in two volumes by the Backus Historical Society
at Newton, Mass., in 1871.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>It is the fourth and last published volume of Dr. Palfrey’s <i>History of New England</i>
(Boston, 1875) which comes within the period of the present chapter, bringing the story,
however, down only to 1741, but a continuation is promised from a MS. left by the author,
and edited by General F. W. Palfrey, his son, which will complete the historian’s
plan by continuing the narrative to the opening of the war of independence. This fourth
volume is amply fortified with references and notes, in excess of the limitations which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
governed the earlier ones. The author says in his preface that he may be thought in
this respect “to have gone excessively into details, and I cannot dispute [he adds] the
justness of the criticism; such at present is the uncontrollable tendency of my mind.”</p>

<p>In 1866 Dr. Palfrey published a popular abridgment of his first three volumes in two
smaller ones. These were reissued in August, 1872, with a third, and in 1873 with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
fourth, which completed the abridgment of his larger work, and carried the story from
the accession of Shirley to power down to the opening of the military history of the American
Revolution. In this admirably concise form, reissued in 1884, with a thorough
index, the work of the chief historian of New England is known as <i>A compendious
History of New England from the Discovery by Europeans to the first general Congress
of the Anglo-American Colonies</i>,&mdash;the last summarized chapter in the work not being
recognized in the title.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Massachusetts.</span>&mdash;For this as well as for the period embraced in the third volume
of the present history,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Thomas Hutchinson’s <i>History of Massachusetts Bay</i> is of the
highest importance. Hutchinson says that he was impelled to write the history of
the colony from observing the repeated destruction of ancient records in Boston by fire,
and he complains that the descendants of some of the first settlers will neither use themselves
nor let others use the papers which have descended to them. He seems, however,
to have had the use of the papers of the elder Elisha Cooke. He acknowledges
the service which the Mather library, begun by Increase Mather, and in Hutchinson’s
time owned by Samuel Mather, who had married Hutchinson’s sister, was to him.</p>

<p>While Hutchinson’s continuation of the story beyond 1749 was as yet unknown, George
Richards Minot planned to take up the narrative and carry it on. Minot’s <i>Continuation
of the History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay from 1748</i> shows that he made use
of the files in the state house as well as their condition then permitted, but he was conscious
of the assistance which he might have had, and did not possess, from the papers
in the English archives. His first volume was printed in 1798; and he died before his
second volume was published, in 1803, which had brought the record down to 1765, but
stopped abruptly.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Grahame (iii. 446) calls the work “creditable to the sense and talent
of its author,” but considers “his style frequently careless, and even slovenly and
ungrammatical.” His contemporaries viewed his literary manner much more favorably,
and were inclined to give him a considerable share in placing our native historical
literature upon a scholarly basis. More painstaking research, with a careful recording of
authorities, characterizes the only other <i>History of Massachusetts</i> of importance, that
by John S. Barry, whose second volume is given to the period now under consideration,&mdash;a
work, however, destitute of commensurate literary skill, or its abundant learning would
give it greater reputation. Haliburton, in chapters 2 and 3 of book iii. of <i>The Rule and
Misrule of the English in America</i>, traces in a summary way the turbulent politics of
the province of Massachusetts during its long struggle against the royal prerogative.
Emory Washburn’s <i>Sketches of the judicial history of Massachusetts from 1630 to the
revolution in 1775</i>, Boston, 1840, contains biographical notices of the judges of Massachusetts,
and traces the relations of the study of the law to the progress of political
events. William Henry Whitmore’s <i>Massachusetts civil list for the colonial and provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
records, 1630-1774</i>, Albany, 1870, is a list of the names and dates of appointment
of all the civil officers constituted by authority of the charters or the local government.
The general histories of Maine (during this period a part of Massachusetts) have been
sufficiently characterized in another place.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Connecticut.</span>&mdash;The <i>History of Connecticut</i>, by Benjamin Trumbull, becomes not of
less value as it approaches his own time. Grahame (ii. 165) says of him that he is
“always distinguished by the accuracy of his statements, but not less distinguished by
his partiality for his own people,” and Palfrey (iv. 226) avers that with all “his gravity
Trumbull had a tendency for sensational traditions,” and both are right. He had not
brought the story down later than 1713, in the volume published at Hartford in 1797. He
says that he availed himself of the material which the ancient ministers and other principal
gentlemen of Connecticut had communicated to Thomas Prince, when that writer was
engaged upon his <i>Chronological Hist. of New England</i>; and in this collection, he adds,
“important information was found, which could have been obtained from no other
source.” Trumbull’s first volume was reprinted at New Haven in 1818, with a portrait
of the author, together with a second volume, bringing the story down to 1764.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Rhode Island.</span>&mdash;Of Rhode Island in the present period, Arnold’s <i>History</i> is the
foremost modern authority.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Mr. William E. Foster has recently prepared, as no. 9 of

history of the eighteenth century, in a <i>Memoir of Stephen Hopkins</i>.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">New Hampshire.</span>&mdash;Dr. Belknap, as the principal historian of New Hampshire, has
been characterized in another place.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The bibliography of his history may find record
here. The first volume, <i>The History of New Hampshire, vol. i., comprehending ... one
complete century from the discovery of the Pascataqua</i>, was read through the press in
Philadelphia (1784) by Ebenezer Hazard.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> This volume was reprinted at Boston in 1792,
where meanwhile vol. ii. (1715-1790) had appeared in 1781, and vol. iii., embracing a geographical
description, was issued in 1792. The imprints of these volumes vary somewhat.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
There was printed at Dover, N. H., in 1812 (some copies have “Boston, 1813”)
a second edition in three volumes, “with large additions and improvements published
from the author’s last manuscript;” but this assertion is not borne out by the book itself.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
A copy of his original edition having such amendments by Belknap had been used in
1810, at Dover, in printing an edition which was never completed, as the copy and what
had been done in type were burned. Before parting with this corrected copy, the representatives
of Dr. Belknap had transferred his memoranda to another copy, and this last
copy is the one referred to in the edition which was printed by John Farmer at Dover
in 1831, called <i>The History of New Hampshire by Jeremy Belknap, from a copy of the
original edition having the author’s last corrections, to which are added notes containing
various corrections and illustrations. By John Farmer.</i><a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> This is called vol. i., and contains
the historical narrative, but does not include the geographical portion (vol. iii. of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
original ed.), which Farmer never added to the publication.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Belknap says that he had
been educated under the influence of Thomas Prince, and that he had used Prince’s
library before it had been despoiled during the Revolution. Of Hutchinson&mdash;and Belknap
was in early manhood before Hutchinson left New England&mdash;he says that while that
historian writes many things regarding New Hampshire which Neal and Douglass have
omitted, he himself omits others, which he did not think it proper to relate. He refers
to Mr. Fitch, of Portsmouth, as having begun to collect notes on New Hampshire history
as early as 1728, and says that he had found in Fitch’s papers some things not elsewhere
obtainable. He also animadverts on errors into which Chalmers had fallen in his <i>Political
Annals of the American Colonies</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">The Documentary History of New
England.</span>&mdash;After the lapsing of the New England
Confederacy consequent upon the charter
of William and Mary, the governments which
made up that group of colonies had no collective
archives. It is only as we search the archives
of the English Public Record Office, and those of
Paris and Canada, including Nova Scotia, that
we find those governments treated collectively.
The <i>Reports</i> of the English Historical Manuscripts
Commission have of late years not only
thrown additional light on our colonial history,
as papers touching it preserved in the muniment
rooms of leading families have been calendared,
but the commission’s labors have also been the
incentive by which the public depositary of records
has been enriched by the transfer of many
papers, which the commission has examined.
Nine of their voluminous reports (up to 1885)
have been printed, and by their indexes clues
have been provided to the documents about New
England history. The <i>Shelburne Papers</i>, belonging
to the Marquis of Lansdowne, which make a
large part of the <i>Fifth Report</i>, while of most interest
in connection with the American Revolution,
reveal not a little concerning the colonial
history of the earlier part of the seventeenth century.
The volumes enumerated in this <i>Report</i>,
which are marked xlv. (1705-1724) and xlvi.
(1686-1766), are of particular interest, referring
entirely to the American colonies. We find here
various papers of the Board of Trade and Plantations
(or copies of them), embracing the replies
from the provincial governors to their
inquiries. In the volume numbered lxi., there
are sundry reports of the attorney and solicitor-general,
to whom had been referred the appeals
of Massachusetts in 1699, and of Connecticut
in 1701; his report of 1705 respecting Jesuits
and papists in the plantations; that of 1707 on
the acts of Massachusetts fining those trading
with the French; that of 1710 on the reservation
of trees in Massachusetts for masts of the
royal navy; that of 1716 on the claim of the
governor of Massachusetts to command the militia
of Rhode Island; that of 1720 on the negative
of the governor reserved in the charter of
Massachusetts; that of 1722 on the question of
the time when the three years that a province
law is open to disapproval properly begins;
that of 1725 on the encroachments of the House
of Representatives on the prerogative of the
Crown; that of 1732 relating to the validity of
acts in Rhode Island, notwithstanding the governor’s
dissent,&mdash;not to name many others.</p>

<p>Another source of documentary help is the
manuscripts of the British Museum, of which
there are printed catalogues; and the enumeration
of the documents in the possession of the
Canadian government,&mdash;of which the quality
can be judged, as they existed in 1858,&mdash;in the
<i>Catalogue of the Library of Parliament</i>, Toronto,
1858, pp. 1541-1655.</p>

<p class="p2">The archives of Massachusetts are probably
not surpassed in richness by those of any other
of the English colonies. The solicitude which
the colonial and provincial government always
felt for their preservation is set forth by Dr.
George H. Moore in appendix v. of his <i>Final
notes on Witchcraft</i> (New York, 1885). In 1821,
Alden Bradford, then secretary of the commonwealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
made a printed statement of “the public
records and documents belonging to the commonwealth”
(pp. 19), but the fullest enumeration
of them was included in a <i>Report to the Legislature
of Massachusetts, made by the Commissioners
... upon the condition of the records, files,
papers, and documents in the Secretary’s department,
Jan., 1885</i> (pp. 42), drawn up by the present
writer. An indication of such of them as
concern the period of the present volume may
be desirable.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The series of bound volumes,

judicious nor uniform, but, as Dr. Palfrey says,
betrays “ingenious disorder,”<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> includes not all,
but the chief part of the papers illustrative of
legislation in the secretary’s office which concern
us in the present chapter and make part of
one hundred and thirty-one volumes. These
come in sequence through vol. 136,&mdash;the
omitted volumes being no. 107 (the revolution
of 1689) and nos. 126 to 129 (the usurpation of
the Andros period). The other volumes as a rule
begin in the colonial period and come down to
about the beginning of the Revolutionary War.
They are enumerated with their topical characteristics
in the <i>Report</i> already referred to (pp. 8,
9). Four volumes of ancient plans, grants, etc.
(1643-1783), accompany the series.</p>

<p>Of the so-called <i>French Archives</i>&mdash;documents
copied in France&mdash;mention has been elsewhere
made, and a considerable portion of them cover
the period now under examination.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>The destruction of the town and court house
in 1747 carried with it the loss of many of the
original records of the colony and province. The
government had already undertaken a transcript
of the records of the General Court, which had
been completed down to 1737; and this copy,
being at the house of Secretary Josiah Willard,
was saved. A third copy was made from this,
and it is this duplicate character which attaches
to the records as we now have them. Transcripts
of these records under the charter of William
and Mary had by its provisions been sent
to the Lords of Trade, session by session, and
orders were at once given to secure these from
1737 to 1746, or a copy of them, for the province
archives. For some reason this was not accomplished
till 1845, when a commissioner was sent
to England for that purpose; and these years
(1737-1746) are thus preserved. None of these
records for the provincial period have been
printed.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The records of the upper branch or
the council were also burned,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and were in a
similar way restored from England. Of the
House of Representatives, or lower branch, we
have no legislative records before 1714, nor of
the legislative action of either branch have we
any complete record before 1714, since neither
the journals of the House nor the legislative
part of the records of the council were sent
over to England, but only the executive part
of the latter, which was apparently made up in
view of such transmission, as Moore represents.
The preservation of the journals of the House is
due to the jealousy which that body felt of Dudley
when he prorogued them in 1715. Because
of their inaction on the paper-money question,
the House, in a moment of indignation, and to
show that they had done something, if not what
the governor liked, voted to have their daily
records printed. The set of these printed journals
in the possession of the State is defective.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
There is not known to be a perfect set of them
in any collection, perhaps not in all the collections
in the state, says Judge Chamberlain,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> who
adds: “Of their value for historical purposes I
have formed a very high opinion. In many respects
they are of more value than the journals
of the General Court, which show results; while
the journals of the House disclose the temper
of the popular branch, and give the history
of many abortive projects which never
reached the journals of the General Court.”<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Of
a series of copies called charters, commissions,
and proclamations, the second volume (1677-1774)
concerns the present inquiry. There is a
file of bound letters beginning in 1701, and it
would seem they are copies in some, perhaps
many, cases of originals in the archives as arranged
by Mr. Felt.</p>

<p>Respecting the French and Indian wars, nine
volumes of the so-called <i>Massachusetts Archives</i>
cover muster-rolls from 1710 to 1774, including
the regiments of Sir Chas. Hobby and others
(1710), the frontier garrisons, those of Annapolis
Royal (1710-11), the expedition to the West
Indies (1740), the campaigns of Crown Point,
Fort William Henry, and Louisbourg (1758), beside
various eastern expeditions and the service
by sea. Of the first Louisbourg (1745) expedition,
there are no rolls, except as made up in
copies from the Pepperrell and Belknap papers
in the library of the Mass. Historical Society.
In addition to these bound papers there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
many others in packages, laid aside by Mr. Felt
in his labor, in some cases for reasons, and in
other cases by oversight or a varying sense of
choice.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Colonial Records</i> of Connecticut for the
present period have come under the supervision
of Mr. C. J. Hoadly, and are carefully edited.
In 1849 about 50,000 documents in the state archives
had been bound in 138 volumes, when
an index was made to them.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The correspondence
of the Connecticut authorities with the
home government (1755-58) has been printed in
the <i>Connecticut Historical Collections</i> (vol. i. p.
257).</p>

<p>For Rhode Island, the continuation of the
<i>Colonial Records</i>, beginning with vol. iii., covers
the period now under consideration. The sessional
papers of 1691-95, however, are wanting,
and were probably sent to England by Bellomont,
whence copies of those for May and June, 1691,
were procured for the Carter-Brown library.
Newport at this time was a leading community
in maritime affairs, and the papers of these years
touch many matters respecting pirates and privateers.
The fifth volume (1741-56) indicates
how Rhode Island at that time kept at sea more
ships than any other colony, how she took part
in the Spanish war, and how reckless her assembly
was in the authorizing of paper money.
The sixth volume (1757-69) closes the provincial
period.</p>

<p>The series of publications of New Hampshire
ordinarily referred to as <i>Provincial Papers</i>, from
the leading series of documents in what is more
properly called <i>Documents and records relating
to New Hampshire</i>, is more helpful in the present
period than in the earlier one.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> They may
be supplemented by the Shute and Wentworth
correspondence (1742-53), and Wentworth’s
correspondence with the ministry (1750-60);
and letters of Joseph Dudley and others, contained
in the Belknap MSS. in the cabinet of
the Mass. Historical Society.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> The <i>Granite
Monthly</i> (vol. v. 391) has published a list of the
issues of the press in New Hampshire from
1756 to 1773; and B. H. Hall’s <i>History of Eastern
Vermont, from its earliest settlement to the
close of the eighteenth century</i>, with a biographical
chapter and appendixes (2 vols., Albany,
N. Y., 1858, and on large paper in 1865), supplements
the story as regards the claim of New
Hampshire to the so-called New Hampshire
grants.</p>

<p class="p2">The legislative and judicial methods of the
several governments are of the first importance
to the understanding of New England history,
for it was a slow process by which it came to
pass that professional lawyers held any shaping
hand in the making or the administering of
laws. The first Superior Court of Massachusetts
under the provincial charter had not a single
trained lawyer on the bench, and its assembly
was equipped more with persistency and
shrewdness in working out its struggle with the
crown officer who tried to rule them than with
legal acquirements. E. G. Scott, in his <i>Development
of Constitutional Liberty in the English
Colonies</i> (N. Y., 1882, pp. 31-58), examines the
forms of the colonial governments and the political
relations of the colonies. No one has
better traced their relations to European politics
than Bancroft.</p>

<p>The legislation of the several governments
has had special treatment in Emory Washburn’s
<i>Sketches of the Judicial History of Massachusetts,
1630-1775</i> (Boston, 1840); in T. Day’s <i>Historical
Account of the Judiciary of Connecticut</i> (Hartford,
1817); in John M. Shirley’s “Early Jurisprudence
of New Hampshire,” in the New
Hampshire Historical Society’s <i>Proceedings</i>,
June 13, 1883. Cf. also H. C. Lodge, <i>Short
Hist. of the English Colonies</i>, pp. 412-419.</p>

<p>Of the legislation of Massachusetts, Dr. Moore
says<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> that it is “a record which, notwithstanding
all its defects, has no parallel in any other
American State.” The first edition of the Province
Laws, under the new charter, was printed
in 1699, and it was annually supplemented by
those of the succeeding sessions till 1714, when
a second edition was printed, to which an index
was added in 1722, and various later editions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
were issued.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> In 1869 the first volume of a new
edition, of historical importance, was published
by the State, with the title <i>Acts and Resolves,
public and private, of the Province of the Massachusetts
Bay, with historical and explanatory
notes, edited by Ellis Ames and Abner C. Goodell</i>.
Mr. Ames has since died (1884), and the editing
is still going on under Mr. Goodell; five volumes,
coming down to 1780, having been so far
published.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Men and Manners.</span>&mdash;Dr. George E.
Ellis, in an address<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> which he delivered in October,
1884, on the occasion of erecting a tablet
to Samuel Sewall’s memory in the new edifice
of the Old South church, in Boston, of which
that last of the puritans had been a member,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Judge Sewall is better known to us in both
his outer and inner being than any other individual
in our local history of two hundred and
fifty years; and this is true not only of himself,
but through his pen, curiously active, faithful,
candid, kind, impartial, and ever just, his own
times stand revealed and described to us. His
surroundings and companions, his home and public
life, the habits, usages, customs, and events,
and even the food which we can almost smell and
taste, the clothes, and furnishings, the modes of
hospitality, of travel, the style of things,&mdash;all
in infinite detail; the military service, the formal
ceremonials and courtesies, the excitements,
panics, disasters,&mdash;all these have come down to
us through Sewall’s pen, with a fullness and old-time
flavor and charm, which we might in vain
seek to gather from many hundred volumes.
And all this comes from Sewall having kept
a daily journal from 1674 to 1729, fifty-five
years,”&mdash;and forty of these years come within
the scope of the present chapter.</p>

<p>These journals had long been known to exist
in a branch of Sewall’s family, but as, Dr. Ellis
says, they “had been kept with much reserve,
sparingly yielding to earnest inquirers the information
they were known to contain.” President
Quincy had drawn from them in his <i>History of
Harvard University</i>, and had called them “curious
and graphic,” as his extracts show. They
had also been used by Holmes in his <i>American
Annals</i>, by Washburn in his <i>Judicial History
of Mass.</i>, and by others. In 1868, some friends
of the Mass. Historical Society purchased the
diaries and other Sewall papers of the holders,
and gave them to the society.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The diaries
have since been published, and make part of
the <i>Collections</i> of that society.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Despite a good
deal of a somewhat ridiculous conservatism,
linked with a surprising pettiness in some ways,
the character of Sewall is impressed upon the
present generation in a way to do him honor.
His was a struggle to uphold declining puritanism,
and the contrasts presented by the viceroyalty
of New England at that time to one who
was bred under the first charter must have
been trying to Christian virtues, even were
they such as Sewall possessed.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Dr. Ellis has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
pointed out<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> how universally kindly Sewall was
in what he recorded of those with whom he came
in contact. “There are no grudges, no animosities,
no malice, no bitter musings, no aggravating
reproaches of those&mdash;some very near him&mdash;who
caused him loss and grief, but ever efforts to reconcile,
by forbearance, remonstrance, and forgiveness.”
All this may be truly said, and afford a
contrast to what the private diaries of his contemporaries,
the two Mathers, would prompt us
to say of their daily records. Those who are
more considerate of the good names of those
divines than they were themselves have thus far
prevented the publication of these diaries. Dr.
Ellis<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> says of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The diaries of Increase and Cotton Mather
are extant, but only extracts of them have been
printed. Much in them is wisely suppressed.
Increase, though a most faithful, devoted, and
eminently serviceable man, was morbid, censorious
sometimes, and suffered as if unappreciated.
The younger Mather was often jealous, spiteful,
rancorous, and revengeful in his daily records,
and thus the estimate of his general worth is so
far reduced through materials furnished by himself.”<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>There is among the Sparks manuscripts in
Harvard College library a bound quarto volume
which is superscribed as follows: “To Mr.
Samuel Savile, of Currier’s Hall, London, attorney-at-law:
Dear friend,&mdash;I here present you
with an abstracted Historical Account of that
part of America called New England; to which
I have added the History of our voiage thereto,
Anno Domini, 1740.” This account presents one
of the best pictures of New England life, particularly
of that in Boston, from a contemporary pen.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
There are various other diaries of lookers-on,
which are helpful in this study of New England
provincial life, like the journals of Whitefield,
the diary of Francis Goelet,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> the journal of
Madam Knight’s journey, 1704,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>&mdash;not to name
others. Among published personal records,
there are George Keith’s <i>Journal of Travels
from New Hampshire to Caratuck</i> (London,
1706); Capt. Nathaniel Uring’s <i>Voyages and
Travels</i>, published at London in 1727;<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> and
Andrew Burnaby’s <i>Travels through the middle
settlements in North America in the years 1759
and 1760</i>, London, 1775.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Burnaby passed on
his way, from Bristol through Providence to Boston.
The early part of the autobiography of
Benjamin Franklin is of exceptional value as a
reflex of the life of New England as it impressed
a young man.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Among the modern treatises on the social
condition of New England, a chief place must
be given to Henry Cabot Lodge’s <i>Short History
of the English Colonies</i>, the chapters in
which on the characteristics of the colonies and
their life are the essential feature of a book
whose title is made good by a somewhat unnecessary
abridgment of the colonies’ anterior
history. Lodge groups his facts by colonies.
Dr. Edward Eggleston in some valuable papers,
which are still appearing in the <i>Century Magazine</i>,
groups similar, but often much minuter,
facts by their topical rather than by their colonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
relations. Mr. Horace E. Scudder prepared
an eclectic presentation of the subject in a little
volume, <i>Men and Manners a hundred years ago</i>
(N. Y., 1876), which surveys all the colonies.
The Rev. Jos. B. Felt’s <i>Customs of New England</i>
(1853) has a topical arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>For Massachusetts in particular, most of the
local histories<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> contribute something to the subject;
and in the <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>
there are various chapters which are useful,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
and a survey is also given in Barry’s <i>Massachusetts</i>
(vol. ii. ch. I).</p>

<p>“He that will understand,” says Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
“the political character of New England in the
eighteenth century must study the constitution
of its towns, its congregations, its schools, and
its militia.”<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b>C.</b> <span class="smcap">Finance and Revenue.</span>&mdash;Dr. J. Hammond
Trumbull in a pamphlet, <i>First Essays at
Banking and the first paper money in New England</i>
(Worcester, 1884,&mdash;from the Council Report
of the American Antiquarian Society, Oct.,
1884), traces more fully than has been done by
Jos. B. Felt, in his <i>Historical account of Massachusetts
Currency</i> (Boston, 1839), and by Paine in
the Council Report of the same society, April,
1866,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> the efforts at private banking previous to
the province issue of bills in 1690, and with particular
reference to a tract, which he ascribes to
the Rev. John Woodbridge, of Newbury, called
<i>Severals relating to the fund, printed for divers
reasons as may appear</i> (Boston, probably 1681-82).<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
Dr. Trumbull attributes to Cotton Mather
a paper sustaining the policy of issuing paper
bills in 1690, which was published as <i>Some considerations
on the Bills of Credit now passing in
New England</i> (Boston, 1691),<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> to which was appended
<i>Some additional considerations</i>, which the
same writer thinks may have been the work of
John Blackwell, who had been the projector of a
private bank authorized in 1689. Similar views
as there expressed are adopted by Mather in his
<i>Life of Phips</i>, as printed separately in 1697, and
as later included in the <i>Magnalia</i>.</p>

<p>In Dec., 1690, the bills of the £7,000 which
were first authorized began to be put forth.
Felt (p. 50) gives the style of them, and though
an engraved form was adopted some of the
earliest of the issues were written with a pen, as
shown by the fac-simile of one in the <i>Proceedings</i>
of the Massachusetts Hist. Soc. (1863, p. 428).
Up to 1702 there had been emissions and repetitions
of emissions of about £110,000, when
another £10,000 was put out. A fac-simile of
one of these notes is given in Smith’s <i>Hist. and
Literary Curiosities</i>, p. xlv. The issues for the
next few years were as follows: 1706, £10,000;
1707, £22,000; 1708, £10,000; 1709, £60,000;
1710, £40,000; 1711, £65,000,&mdash;a total of
£207,000.</p>

<p>In the following year (1712), the province bills
of Massachusetts were made legal tender,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> but
the break had come. The public confidence was
shaken, and their decline in value rapidly increased
under the apprehension, which the repeated
putting off of the term of redemption
engendered.</p>

<p>In Connecticut the management was more
prudent. She issued in the end £33,500, but all
her bills were redeemed with scarce any depreciation.
A fac-simile of one of her three-shilling
bills (1709) is given in the <i>Connecticut Colony
Records</i>, 1706-1716, p. 111.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>Rhode Island managed her issues wildly. The
history of her financial recklessness, by E. R.
Potter, was published in 1837, and reprinted by
Henry Phillips, Jr., in his <i>Historical Sketches</i>, etc.
This paper as enlarged by S. S. Rider in 1880,
constitutes no. viii. of the <i>Rhode Island Historical
Tracts</i>, under the title of <i>Bills of Credit and
Paper Money of Rhode Island, 1710-1786</i>, with
twenty fac-similes of early bills. In 1741 Gov.
Ward made an official report to the Lords Commissioners
of Trade, rehearsing the history of
the Rhode Island issues from 1710 to 1740, and
this report, with other documents relating to the
paper money of that colony, is in the <i>Rhode
Island Col. Records</i>, vol. v. (1741-56).</p>

<p>Towards the end of Dudley’s time in Massachusetts,
the party lines became sharply drawn
on questions of financial policy. The downfall
of credit alarmed the rich and conservative.
The active business men, not many in numbers,
but strong in influence, found a flow of paper
money helpful in making the capital of the rich
and the labor of the poor subserve their interests,
as Hildreth says. There were those who supposed
some amelioration would come from banks,
private and public, and the press teemed with
pamphlets.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The aggressive policy was formulated
in <i>A Projection for erecting a Bank of
Credit in Boston, New England, founded on Land

it in a pamphlet, <i>Objections to the Bank of
Credit lately projected at Boston</i><a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> (Oct., 1714),
to which an answer came in Dec., from Samuel
Lynde and other upholders, called <i>A Vindication
of the Bank of Credit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> “Of nearly thirty pamphlets
and tracts, printed from 1714 to 1721,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
for or against a private bank or a public bank,”
says Dr. Trumbull,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> “that of Dudley was the first,
and is in some respects the ablest;” but he places
foremost among the advocates of the scheme
the author of <i>A Word of Comfort to a Melancholy
Country</i> (Boston, 1721), purporting to be by
“Amicus Patriæ,” or, as Trumbull thinks (p.
40) there is little doubt, by the famous Rev. John
Wise, of Chebacco. (Cf. <i>Brinley Catal.</i>, i. nos.
1,442-45.)</p>

<p>To forestall the action of the private bank,
the province, by a law, issued £50,000 to be let
out on mortgages of real estate, and these bills
were in circulation for over thirty years, and the
assembly took other action to prevent the Land-bank
scheme being operative. The subsequent
emissions of paper money can be traced in Felt,
who also cites the contemporary tracts, ranged
upon opposite sides, and supporting on the one
hand the conservative views of the Council, and
on the other the heedless precipitancy of the
House. One of these, <i>The Distressed state of the
town of Boston considered ... in a letter from a
gentleman to his friend in the country</i> (1720),
excited the attention of the council as embodying
reflections on the acts of the government.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>In 1722 bills of as small a denomination as
one, two, and three pennies<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> were ordered,
to provide small change, which had become
scarce.</p>

<p>The financial situation was rapidly growing
worse. In 1710 an ounce of silver was worth eight
shillings in paper, and in 1727 it had risen to
seventeen shillings; and at this time, or near it
(1728), there was afloat about £314,000 of this
paper of Massachusetts indebtedness, to say
nothing of a similar circulation issued by the
other colonies, that of Rhode Island showing a
much greater depreciation.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> The fall in value
was still increasing when in 1731 there were
plans of bringing gold and silver into the country
for a medium of trade;<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> but naturally the
needy mercantile class opposed it. Thomas
Hutchinson early (1737-38) distinguished himself
in the assembly as a consistent opposer of
paper money, and in 1740 he tried to push a
scheme to hire in England 220,000 ounces of
gold to meet the province bills, but he had little
success. Another<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> scheme, however, flourished
for a while; and this was one reviving the
old name of the Land-bank, though sometimes
called “Manufactory bank,” a bill for which was
set afoot by Mr. John Colman, a needy Boston
merchant, as Hutchinson calls him. Its principal
feature consisted in securing the issues of
the bank by a mortgage on the real estate of
each associate to the extent of his subscription.
It found its support in the small traders and the
people of the rural districts, and was sustained
in general by the House of Representatives.
The leading and well-to-do merchants opposed
it, and set up what was called a “Silver Scheme,”&mdash;an
issue of notes to be redeemed in silver
after the lapse of ten years.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> “Mr. Hutchinson,”
as this gentleman himself records, “favored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
neither, but considered the silver plan as without
fraudulent purpose, which he did not think
could be the case with the Land-bank.”<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>The favoring and the opposing of the popular
measure of the Land-bank drew lines sharply in
the current political contests. The governor
was suspected of double dealing, and while he
was believed to be personally interested in it, he
carried out openly the opposition which the
Board of Trade instructed him to pursue: rejected
the speaker and committees of the House,
who were urging its progress, and displaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
justices and militia officers of that way of thinking.
All the while rumors of riot began to
prevail, but they were not sufficient to coerce the
government in a relaxation of their opposition;
and the governor on his side carried espionage
to a degree which was novel. It is said that
something over £50,000 of the bank’s bills actually
got out; but some one discovered that an
old act of Parliament, which came of the explosion
of the South Sea company, held each partner
responsible, and nothing else was needed to
push the adventure out of existence.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Felt gives the main points in the development
of this financial scheme, but here as elsewhere
his book is a mere conglomerate of ill-digested

<p>A fortunate plan for withdrawing the debased
paper currency of Massachusetts Bay was finally
matured.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Though the taking of Louisbourg
had severely taxed the colony with a financial
burden, the loss of it by treaty now made the
way clear to throw off the same burden. William
Bollan, the son-in-law of Shirley, had gone
over after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle to represent
how the sacrifices of New England deserved
more recognition than was seemingly
paid them in the surrender of her conquest.
This and other reasons prevailed, and the government
agreed to reimburse the province for
the cost of the siege. This was reckoned on the
new basis of paper money. Shirley in 1743 had
been allowed to give his assent to an issue
called “new tenor,” in which the value to silver
was about ten times as great as the enormous
flood of issues then in circulation bore, and these
last were now known as “old tenor.” On this
new basis Louisbourg had cost £261,700, which
was held to be equivalent to £183,600 in London,
the pound sterling equalling now about 30
shillings of the new tenor, and £11 of the old.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
This agreement had been reached in 1749,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> and
the specie was shipped to Boston. Two hundred
and seventeen chests of Spanish dollars
and a hundred casks of copper coin were carted
up King Street, in September, the harbinger of
new prosperity. It was due most to Thomas
Hutchinson’s skilful urgency that the assembly,
of which he was now speaker, was induced to
devote this specie to the redeeming of the paper
bills of the “old tenor,” of which £2,000,000
were in circulation.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> It was agreed to pay about
one pound in specie for ten in paper, and the
commissioners closed their labors in 1751, the
silver and copper already mentioned paying
nine tenths of it, while a tax was laid to pay the
remaining tenth. About £1,800,000 in current
bills were presented; the rest had been destroyed
or hid away and forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Rhode Island had
received £6,322 as her share of the whole; but
as she was not wise enough to apply it to the
bettering of her currency, she suffered the evils
of a depreciated paper longer than her neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
The same lack of wisdom governed New
Hampshire. Connecticut had always been conservative
in her monetary practices.</p>

<p>When the Massachusetts Assembly, in 1754,
sought to raise money for the expenses of the
war then impending, its debate upon an inquisitorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
excise bill levying a tax on wines and liquors
incited violent opposition. Samuel Cooper
launched at the plan a pamphlet called <i>The Crisis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
Another brief attack appeared with nothing
on the title but <i>The Eclipse, MDCCLIV.</i><a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
Daniel Fowle, however, was accused of printing
another satirical account of the Representatives’
proceedings, which was published in
1754 as <i>The Monster of Monsters</i>, and the
“Thomas Thumb, Esq.,” of the title is supposed
to have shielded Samuel Waterhouse. Fowle
was arrested, and the common hangman was directed
to burn the pamphlet in King Street.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
Sabin says that not more than three or four
copies of the tract escaped, but the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>
shows two.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> After his release Fowle
printed in Boston the next year (1755) <i>A total
Eclipse of Liberty. Being a true and faithful
account of the arraignment and examination of
Daniel Fowle before the House of Representatives
of Massachusetts Bay, Oct. 24, 1754, barely on

<p>In May, 1755, a stamp act went into operation
in the province, by which the Representatives
had established duties upon vellum, parchment,
and paper for two years. It yielded towards
defraying the charges of the government
about £1,350 for the years in question.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Shirley
issued a proclamation of its conditions, one
of which is in the Boston Public Library, and
has been reprinted in its <i>Bulletin</i>, 1884, p. 163.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>D.</b> <span class="smcap">The Bounds of the New England
Colonies.</span>&mdash;During the provincial period, the
external limits and internal divisions of New
England were the subject of disagreement. The
question as to what constituted the frontier line
towards Acadia was constantly in dispute, as is
explained elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>On the western side New York had begun by
claiming jurisdiction as far as the Connecticut
River. She relinquished this claim in the main,
as to her bounds on Connecticut, when that colony
pressed her pretensions to a line which ran
a score of miles from the Hudson, and when she
occupied the territory with her settlers, the final
adjustment being reached in 1731.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>On the line of Massachusetts the controversy
with New York lasted longer. The claim of
that province was set forth in a <i>Report</i> made in
1753, which is printed in Smith’s <i>New York</i>
(1814 ed., p. 283), and Smith adds that the government
of Massachusetts never exhibited the
reasons of its claim in answer to this report,
but in the spring of 1755 sold lands within the
disputed territory.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> In 1764 the matter was
again in controversy. Thomas Hutchinson is
thought to have been the author of the Massachusetts
argument called <i>The Case of the Provinces
of Massachusetts Bay and New York, respecting
boundary line between the two provinces</i>
(Boston, 1764).<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Three years later (1767) a
meeting of the agents of the two provinces was
held at New Haven, by which the disagreement
was brought to a conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>For the region north of Massachusetts New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
York contended more vigorously, and the dispute
over the New Hampshire grants in the territory
of the present Vermont, which began in
1749, was continued into the Revolutionary period.
When, in 1740, the king in council had
established the northern line of Massachusetts,
the commission of Gov. Benning Wentworth, of
New Hampshire, the next year (1741), extended
his jurisdiction westward until it met other
grants, which he interpreted to mean till it
reached a line stretched northerly in prolongation
of the westerly boundary of Massachusetts,
twenty miles east of the Hudson, and reaching
to the southern extremity of Lake Champlain.
On the 3d of Jan., 1749, Wentworth made a
grant of the town of Bennington, adjacent to
such western frontier line. These and other
grants of townships which Wentworth made became
known as the New Hampshire Grants.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
The wars prevented much progress in the settlement
of these grants, but some of the settlers
who were there when the French war closed assembled,
it is said, with the Rev. Samuel Peters
in 1763 on Mount Pisgah, and broke a bottle of
spirits with him, and named the country <i>Verd
Mont</i>.</p>

<p>Gov. Colden, of New York, on Dec. 28, 1763,
issued a proclamation claiming the land thus
held under the grants of Wentworth, basing his
rights on the grants in 1664 and 1674 to the
Duke of York of “all lands from the west side
of the Connecticut River to the east side of the
Delaware Bay.” On the 20th July, 1764, the
king in council confirmed Colden’s view, and
made the Connecticut River the boundary as
far as 45° north latitude. When this decision
reached Wentworth he had already granted 128
townships. New York began to make counter-grants
of the same land, and though the king
ordered the authorities of New York to desist,
when word reached London of the rising conflict,
it was the angry people of the grants rather
than the royal will which induced the agents of
New York to leave the territory. Gov. John
Wentworth continued to make grants till the
Revolution, on the New Hampshire side; but
though Gov. Moore, of New York, had been restrained
(1767), his successors had not the same
fear of the royal displeasure. As the war approached,
the dispute between New York and
the grants grew warmer.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> In 1773 James Duane,
it is thought, was the champion of the New
York cause in two pamphlets: <i>A State of the
rights of the Colony of New York with respect to
its eastern boundary on Connecticut River so far
as concerns the late encroachments under the Government
of New Hampshire</i>, published by the
assembly (New York, 1773); and <i>A Narrative
of the proceedings subsequent to the Royal Adjudication
concerning the lands to the westward of
Connecticut river, lately usurped by New Hampshire</i>
(New York, 1773).<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> The next year (1774)
Ethan Allen answered the first of these tracts
in his <i>Brief narrative of the proceedings of the
government of New York</i>. Allen dated at Bennington,
Sept. 23, 1774, and his book was published
at Hartford.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The war of independence soon gave opportunity
for the British authorities on the Canada
side to seek to detach the Vermonters from their
relations to the revolting colonies.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> The last
of the royal governors of New Hampshire had
fled in Sept., 1775, and a congress at Exeter
had assumed executive control in Jan., 1776.
The next year (1777) a convention framed a constitution,
and by a stretch of power, as is told in
Ira Allen’s <i>Hist. of Vermont</i>, it was adopted
without recurrence to the people’s vote. In
March, 1778, the state government was fully organized.
The dispute with New York went on.
Gov. Clinton issued a proclamation. Ethan
Allen answered in an <i>Animadversary Address</i>
(Hartford, 1778),<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> and in Dec., 1778, a convention
of the people of the grants was held, and
their resolution was appended to a document prepared
by a committee of the assembly, called <i>A
public defence of the right of the New Hampshire
grants (so called) on both sides Connecticut river,
to associate together, and form themselves into an
independent state. Containing remarks on sundry
paragraphs of letters from the president of the
Council of New Hampshire to his Excellency Governor
Chittenden, and the New Hampshire delegates
at Congress</i>.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The same year the legislature of New York
directed the preparation of a <i>Collection of evidence
in vindication of the territorial rights and
jurisdiction of the state of New York, against the
claims of the commonwealth of Massachusetts and
New Hampshire, and the people of the grants who
are commonly called Vermonters</i>. It was prepared
by James Duane, James Morrin Scott,
and Egbert Benson, and is printed in the <i>Fund
Publications</i> of the New York Historical Society,
1870 (pp. 277-528). On the other side,
Ethan Allen published <i>A vindication of the opposition
of the inhabitants of Vermont to the government
of New York, and of their right to form an
independent state</i>;<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> and in 1780, in connection
with Jonas Fay, and by order of the governor
and council, he published <i>A concise refutation of
the claims of New Hampshire and Massachusetts
Bay, to the territory of Vermont; with occasional
remarks on the long disputed claim of New York
to the same</i>.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>In 1782, Ethan Allen again brought out at
Hartford his <i>The present state of the controversy
between the states of New York and New Hampshire
on the one part, and the state of Vermont on
the other</i>.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>The arguments and proofs were rehearsed in
1784, when the question was to be presented to
court, in a brief by James Duane, called <i>State of
the evidence and argument in support of the territorial
rights of jurisdiction of New York against the
government of New Hampshire and the claimants
under it, and against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts</i>.
An amicable adjustment prevented
the publication of this document, and it was first
printed in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i> for 1871.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Connecticut claimed certain lands in Northern
Pennsylvania, which came within her jurisdiction
by the extension of her lines, as expressed
in her charter of 1662, westward to
the South Sea. New York, being then in the
possession of a Christian power, was excepted,
but the claim was preserved farther west. In
1753 a company was formed to colonize these
Connecticut lands in the Susquehanna valley,
and lands were bought of the Indians at Wyoming.
The government of Pennsylvania objected,
and claimed the lands to be within the
bounds of William Penn’s charter. (Cf. <i>Penna.
Archives</i>, ii. 120, etc.) The defeat of Braddock
checked the dispute, but in 1761 it was renewed.
In 1763 the home government required the Connecticut
people to desist, on the ground that they
had not satisfied the Indian owners. New bargains
were then made, and in 1769 settlements
again took place. General Gage, as commander-in-chief
of the British troops on the continent,
refused to interfere. In 1774, William Smith
prepared an <i>Examination of the Connecticut claim
to lands in Pennsylvania, with an appendix and
map</i> (Philadelphia, 1774); and Benjamin Trumbull
issued <i>A Plea in vindication of the Connecticut
title to the contested lands west of the Province
of New York</i> (New Haven, 1774). See entries in
the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, Nos. 2121, etc. The dispute
was later referred to the Continental Congress,
which in 1781 decided in favor of Pennsylvania,
and Aug. 8, 1782, commissioners were
appointed. (<i>Journals of Congress</i>, iv. 59, 64.)
Connecticut still claimed west of Pennsylvania,
and though she retained for a while the “Western
Reserve,” she finally ceded (1796-1800) to
the United States all her claims as far as the
Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> The claims of Massachusetts, on
similar grounds, to land in Michigan and Wisconsin
were surrendered to the general government
in 1785.</p>

<p class="p2">The original patent for the Massachusetts
Company made its northern line three miles
north of the Merrimac River. New Hampshire
claimed that it should be run westerly from a
point on the coast three miles north of the mouth
of that river. When the Board of Trade, in
1737, selected a commission to adjudicate upon
this claim, Massachusetts was not in favor, and
New Hampshire got more than she asked, the
line being run north of the river three miles,
and parallel to it, till it reached the most southerly
point of the river’s course, when it was continued
due west.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the boundaries on the side of
Maine, there is a journal of Walter Bryent, who
in 1741 ran the line between New Hampshire
and York County in Maine.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Massachusetts also lost territory in the south.
The country of King Philip on the easterly side
of Narragansett Bay had been claimed by Plymouth,
and Massachusetts, by the union under
the province charter, succeeded to the older colony’s
claim. An arbitration in 1741 did not give
all she claimed to Rhode Island, but it added
the eastern towns along the bay.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> On the frontiers
of Connecticut, the towns of Enfield, Suffield,
Somers, and Woodstock had been settled
by Massachusetts, and by an agreement in 1713
she had included them in her jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> In
1747, finding the taxes in Massachusetts burdensome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
from the expenses of the war, these towns
applied to be received by Connecticut, and their
wish was acceded to, while Massachusetts did
not dare risk an appeal to the king in council.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The disputes of Connecticut and Rhode Island
respecting the Narragansett country resulted
on that side in a loss to Connecticut.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>In an interesting paper on the “Origin of the
names of towns in Massachusetts,” by William
H. Whitmore, in the <i>Proceedings</i> (xii. 393-419)
of the Mass. Hist. Society, we can trace the loss
of towns to Massachusetts, which she had incorporated,
and find some reflection of political
changes. Up to 1732 the names of towns were
supplied by the petitioners, but after that date
the incorporation was made in blank, the governor
filling in the name, which may account
for the large number of names of English peers
and statesmen which were attached to Massachusetts
towns during the provincial period.
The largest class of the early names seems due
to the names of the places in England whence
their early settlers came. Prof. F. B. Dexter
presented to the American Antiquarian Society,
in April, 1885, a paper of similar character respecting
the towns of Connecticut.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>E.</b> <span class="smcap">Forts and Frontier Towns of New
England.</span>&mdash;The large increase during recent
years in the study of local history has greatly
broadened the field of detail. As scarcely one
of the older settlements to the west, north, and
east escaped the horrors of the French and Indian
wars, the student following out the minor
phases must look into the histories of the towns
of New England. Convenient finding-lists for
these towns are the <i>Check-list of Amer. local history</i>,
by F. B. Perkins; Colburn’s <i>Bibliog. of Massachusetts</i>;
Bartlett’s <i>Bibliog. of Rhode Island</i>;
and A. P. C. Griffin’s “Articles on American
local history in Historical Collections, etc.,” now
publishing in the <i>Boston Public Library Bulletin</i>.</p>

<p>For the Maine towns particular reference may
be made to Cyrus Eaton’s <i>Thomaston, Rockland,
and South Thomaston</i> (1863), vol. i.; E. E.
Bourne’s <i>Wells and Kennebunk</i>; Cushman’s <i>Ancient
Sheepscot and Newcastle</i>; Willis’s <i>Portland</i>
(2d ed.); Folsom’s <i>Saco and Biddeford</i>; Eaton’s
<i>Warren</i> (2d ed.), which gives a map, marking
the sites of the forts about the Georges River;
Johnston’s <i>Bristol, Bremen, and Pemaquid</i>, which
gives a map of the Damariscotta River and the
Pemaquid region, with the settlements of 1751;
R. K. Sewall’s <i>Ancient Dominions of Maine</i>;
James W. North’s <i>Augusta</i>; G. A. and H. W.
Wheeler’s <i>Brunswick, Topsham, and Harpswell,
including the ancient territory known as Pejepscot,
Boston</i>, 1878 (ch. iv. and xxiii.).</p>

<p>See the present <i>History</i> (Vol. III. p. 365) for
notes on the local history of Maine, and (Ibid.,
p. 364) for references to the general historians,&mdash;Sullivan,
whose want of perspicuousness Grahame
(i. 253) complains of, and Williamson.</p>

<p>At the present Brunswick (Maine), Fort Andros
had been built in 1688, and had been demolished
in 1694. Capt. John Gyles erected there
in August, 1715, a post which was called Fort
George. Ruins of it were noticeable at the beginning
of this century. There is a sketch of it
in Wheeler’s <i>Brunswick, Topsham, and Harpswell</i>,
pp. 624, 629.</p>

<p>The fort at St. Georges (Thomaston, Me.)
had been built originally in 1719-20, to protect
the Waldo patent; it was improved in 1740, and
again in 1752 was considerably strengthened.
(Williamson, i. 287.)</p>

<p>At Pemaquid, on the spot where Andros had
established a post, Phips had built Fort William
Henry in 1692, which had been surrendered by
Chubb in 1696. It is described in Dummer’s
<i>Defence of the New England Charters</i>, p. 31;
Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i>, book viii. p. 81. In 1729
Col. David Dunbar erected a stone fort, perhaps
on the same foundations, which was called Fort
Frederick. There is a plan of the latter post in
Johnston’s <i>Bristol, Bremen, and Pemaquid</i>, pp.
216, 264. Cf. Eaton’s <i>Warren</i>, 2d ed.</p>

<p>Further down the Kennebec River and opposite
the upper end of Swan Island stood Fort
Richmond, which had been built by the Massachusetts
people about 1723. Near the present
Augusta the Plymouth Company founded Forts
Shirley and Western in 1754. There are plans
and views of them in J. W. North’s <i>Augusta</i>,
pp. 47-49. Cf. Nathan Weston’s <i>Oration at the
Centennial Celebration of the Erection of Fort
Western, July 4, 1854</i>, Augusta, 1854.</p>

<p>Col. John Winslow planned, in 1754, on a
point half a mile below Teconick Falls, the
structure known as Fort Halifax, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the extent shown by the dotted line in the annexed
cut.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Winslow’s letter to Shirley, with the
plan, is in the <i>Mass. Archives,</i> and both are given
in North’s <i>Augusta,</i> pp. 59, 60. The fort was
completed the next year by William Lithgow, as
shown by the black part of the cut, the rear
flanker, forming the centre of the original plan,
having been built, however, by Winslow. This
block-house measured 20 × 20 feet below, and
on the overhang 27 × 27 feet. The narrower of
the large structures was the barracks, also raised
by Winslow, but removed by Lithgow, who built
the other portions.</p>

<p>The cut follows a reconstruction-draft,
made by Mr. T. O. Paine, which
is given by North (p. 62). The flanker nearest
the river is still standing, and the upright planks
on the side, as shown in the annexed cut, mark
the efforts which have been made of late to secure
the timbers. In the Maine Historical Society’s
<i>Collections,</i> vol. viii. p. 198, is a history of
the fort by William Goold, as well as the annexed
cut of a restoration of the entire fort,
drawn by that gentleman from descriptions, from
the tracings of the foundations, and from the remaining
flanker. The preceding volume (vii.)
of the same <i>Collections</i> had contained “materials
for a history” of the fort, edited by Joseph Williamson,&mdash;mainly
documents from the <i>Mass.
Archives.</i> A journal of the march of Capt.
Eleazer Melvin’s company in Gov. Shirley’s expedition
to the Norridgewock country, when Fort
Halifax was erected in 1754, kept by John Barber
(May 30, 1754-Aug. 17, 1754), is in <i>N.
E. Hist. and Gen. Reg.</i>, 1873, pp. 281-85. Cf.
further in Williamson’s <i>Maine</i>, i. 300; Hutchinson’s
<i>Massachusetts</i>, iii. 26. A plan (1754) of the
Kennebec River forts, by John Indicott (measuring
3<span class="reduct"><sup>8</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span> × 1<span class="reduct"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>), is noted in the <i>Catalogue of the
King’s Maps</i> (i. 580), in the British Museum.
The forts on the Kennebec, and the chief localities
of that river, are described by Col. William
Lithgow in 1767, in a deposition printed in the
<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1870, p. 21. Lithgow
was then fifty-two years old, and had known
the river from childhood.</p>

<p>A paper by Richard Pike, on the building and
occupancy of Fort Pownall, on the Penobscot, is
in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Gen. Reg.</i>, 1860, p. 4. In
Williamson’s <i>Belfast</i>, p. 56, is a conjectural view
of the fort, drawn from the descriptions and
from a survey of the site in 1828. <i>A Survey of
the river and bay of Penobscot, by order of Gov.
Pownall</i>, 1759, is among the king’s maps (Catal.,
ii. 167) in the British Museum. A journal of
Pownall’s expedition to begin this fort was printed,
with notes, by Joseph Williamson in the
<i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i>, v. 363. Cf. Williamson’s
<i>Maine</i>, i. 337. This fort was completed in July,
1759, at a cost of £5,000, and stood till 1775.

<p>This enumeration covers the principal fortified
posts in the disputed territory at the eastward;
but numerous other garrison posts, block-houses,
and stockades were scattered over the
country.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> A view of one of these, known as Larrabee’s
garrison stockade, is given in Bourne’s
<i>Wells and Kennebunk</i>, ch. xxi. The view of a
block-house built in 1714, near the junction of
the Kennebec and Sebasticook rivers, as sketched
in 1852, is annexed.</p>

<p>West of Maine the frontier stretched from
the Piscataqua to the valley of the Housatonic.</p>

<p>For the New Hampshire part of this line,
Belknap’s <i>Hist. of New Hampshire</i> must be supplemented
for a general survey by B. H. Hall’s
<i>Eastern Vermont</i>. So far as the muster-rolls of
frontier service show the activity in New Hampshire,
it can be gathered from the second volume
of the <i>Report of the Adjutant-General of New
Hampshire</i>, 1866, supplemented by others given
in the <i>N. H. Revolutionary Rolls</i>, vol. i. (1886).
The volumes of the series of <i>Provincial Papers</i>
published by that State (vols. ix., xi., xii., xiii.),
and called “Town Papers, 1638-1784,” give the
local records. The principal town histories detailing
the events of the wars are Potter’s <i>Manchester</i>;
Bouton’s <i>Concord</i>; Runnel’s <i>Sanbornton</i>;
Little’s <i>Warren</i>; C. C. Coffin’s <i>Boscawen</i>;
H. H. Saunderson’s <i>Charlestown</i>; B. Chase’s

<p>In 1704 the assembly of New Hampshire ordered
that every householder should provide
himself with snow-shoes, for the use of winter
scouting parties. (<i>N. H. Prov. Papers</i>, iii. 290.)
In 1724 Fort Dummer was built near the modern
Brattleboro, in territory then claimed by
Massachusetts. (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, x. 109, 141, 178;
<i>N. H. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i. 143; <i>N. H. Adj.-Gen.
Rept.</i>, 1866, ii. p. 122.) In 1746, after the alarm
over the D’Anville fleet had subsided, Atkinson’s
New Hampshire regiment was sent north
to meet any invasion from Canada. (<i>N. H.
Adj.-Gen. Rept.</i>, 1866, ii. 83.) The next year
(1747), Walter Bryent advanced with his regiment
as far as Lake Winnepesaukee. (<i>N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, July, 1878, p. 297; N. H.
Prov. Papers, v. 431, 471; Belknap, ii. 228.)</p>

<p>In 1747 the fort at “no. 4,” or Charlestown,
the outpost towards Canada, was attacked.
(Saunderson’s <i>Charlestown</i>; Stone’s <i>Sir William
Johnson</i>, i. 260.)</p>

<p>In 1752-54 there is record of the hostilities on
the New Hampshire borders in the <i>N. H. Prov.
Papers</i>, vi. 301, 310-319.</p>

<p>The St. Francis Indians confronted the settlements
of the upper Connecticut, and in 1752
Shirley sent Capt. Phineas Stevens to treat with
them in the presence of the governor of Canada.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>

<p>In 1694-95, the frontier line of Massachusetts
was established by law as including the towns of
Amesbury, Haverhill, Dunstable, Chelmsford,
Groton, Lancaster, Marlborough, and Deerfield.
Five years later this list was increased by Brookfield,
Mendon, and Woodstock, with a kind of
inner line, running through Salisbury, Andover,
Billerica, Hatfield, Hadley, Westfield, and Northampton.</p>

<p>For the border troubles of Massachusetts, beside
Penhallow and Niles, Neal and Douglass,
and the <i>Magnalia</i>, we turn to Hutchinson with
confidence in the facilities which he enjoyed;
but John Adams says (<i>Works</i>, x. 361), “When
Mr. Hutchinson’s <i>History of Massachusetts Bay</i>
first appeared, one of the most common criticisms
upon it was the slight, cold, and unfeeling
manner in which he passed over the Indian
wars.”</p>

<p>The most exposed towns fronting the New
Hampshire line were Haverhill, Andover, and
Dunstable. The <i>History of Haverhill</i>, by G. W.
Chase (1861), gives the story of the Indian troubles
with much detail.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> For Andover they may be
found in S. L. Bailey’s <i>Historical Sketches of Andover</i>
(Boston, 1880); and for Dunstable in Elias
Nason’s <i>History of Dunstable</i> (1877). Just below
Dunstable lay Groton, and Dr. Samuel A.
Green’s <i>Groton during the Indian Wars</i> supplies
the want here,&mdash;a good supplement to Butler’s
<i>Groton</i>. The frontiers for a while were marked
nearly along the same meridian by Lancaster,
Marlborough, Brookfield, and Oxford. The
<i>Early records of Lancaster, 1643-1725</i>, <i>edited by
H. S. Nourse</i> (Lancaster, 1884), furnishes us with
a full reflection of border experiences during
King William’s, Queen Anne’s, and Lovewell’s
wars, and it may be supplemented by A. P. Marvin’s
<i>History of Lancaster</i>. The sixth chapter of
Charles Hudson’s <i>Marlborough</i> (Boston, 1862),
and Nathan Fiske’s <i>Historical Discourse on Brookfield
and its distresses during the Indian Wars</i>
(Boston, 1776), illustrate the period. The struggle
of the Huguenots to maintain themselves
at Oxford against the Indians is told in Geo.
F. Daniels’ <i>Huguenots in the Nipmuck Country</i>
(1880), and in C. W. Baird’s <i>Hist. of the Huguenot
Emigration to America</i> (1885).</p>

<p>There is in the cabinet of the Mass. Hist. Soc.
(<i>Misc. Papers</i>, 41.41) an early plan of the Connecticut
and Housatonic valleys, showing the
former from the sea as far north as Fort Massachusetts,
and the latter up to Fort Dummer, and
bearing annotations by Thomas Prince.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Connecticut, Northfield
held the northernmost post within the Massachusetts
bounds as finally settled. One of the
best of our local histories for the details of this
barbaric warfare is Temple and Sheldon’s <i>History
of Northfield</i>. Deerfield was just south, and
it is a centre of interest. The attack which
makes it famous came Feb. 29, 1704-5, and the
narrative of the Rev. John Williams, who was
taken captive to Canada, is the chief contemporary
account. Gov. Dudley sent William Dudley
to Quebec to effect the release of the prisoners,
and among those who returned to Boston (Oct.
25, 1706) was Williams, who soon put to press
his <i>Redeemed Captive</i>,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> which was published in

<p>By the time of Shirley’s war (1744-48), the
frontier line had been pushed westerly to the
line of the Housatonic,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> and at Poontoosuck we
find the exposed garrison life repeated, and its
gloom and perils narrated in J. E. A. Smith’s
<i>History of Pittsfield</i>, 1734-1800 (Boston, 1869).
William Williams, long a distinguished resident
of this latter town, had been detailed from the
Hampshire<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> militia in 1743 to connect the Connecticut
and the Hudson with a line of posts,
and he constructed forts at the present Heath,
Rowe, and Williamstown, known respectively as
forts Shirley,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Pelham, and Massachusetts. In
August, 1746, the latter post, whose garrison was
depleted to render assistance during the eastward
war, was attacked by the French and Indians,
and destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>Fort Massachusetts was rebuilt, and its charge,
in June, 1747, committed to Major Ephraim Williams.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
It became the headquarters of the forts
and block-houses scattered throughout the region
now the county of Berkshire, maintaining
garrisons drawn from the neighboring settlers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and at times from the province forces in part.
The plans of one of these fortified posts are preserved
in the state archives, and from the drawings
given in Smith’s <i>Pittsfield</i> (p. 106) the annexed
cuts are made.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>In 1754 the charge of the western frontier was
given to Col. Israel Williams.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>These Berkshire garrisons were in some measure
assisted by recruits from Connecticut, as that
colony could best protect in this way its own
frontiers to the northward. Beside the general
histories of Connecticut, this part of her history
is treated in local monographs like Bronson’s

<p class="pc1 mid">THE MIDDLE COLONIES.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY BERTHOLD FERNOW,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Keeper of the Historical MSS., N. Y. State</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE thirteenth volume of the New York Colonial Manuscripts contains
a document called “Rolle van t’Volck sullende met het Schip den
Otter na Niēu Nederlandt overvaren,” April 24, 1660, being a list of the
soldiers who were to sail in the ship “Otter” for New Netherland.
Among these soldiers was one Jacob Leisler, from Frankfort, who upon arriving
at New Amsterdam found himself indebted to the West India Company
for passage and other advances to the amount of nearly one hundred
florins.</p>

<div class="floatright">

<p>Twenty-nine years later this same quondam soldier administered the
affairs of the colony of New York as lieutenant-governor, not appointed
and commissioned by the
king of England, but called
to the position by the people
of the colony. When the
first rumors of the “happy
revolution” in England
reached New York, Sir Edmond
Andros, the governor-general
of New York and
New England, was absent
in Boston, where the citizens
forcibly detained him.
Nicholson, the lieutenant-governor,
and one or two
other high officials belonged to the Church of Rome, and were therefore
disliked and suspected by the predominant Protestant population.
Rumors had found their way, meanwhile, through the northern wilderness,
that the French in Canada were making preparations to invade New York,
hoping, with the assistance of the Catholics in the province, to wrest it
from the English. The major part of the inhabitants were still Dutch or
of Dutch origin, and these were nearly all Protestants. They were easily
led to believe that the papists within and without the government had concerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to seize Fort James, in New York, and to surrender that post and
the province to a French fleet, which was already on the way from Europe.
The prompting of the Protestant party to anticipate any such hostile movement
was strengthened when they heard the result of the revolution in England.
Leisler, placing himself at the head of this anticipatory movement,
seized the fort, and was shortly afterwards proclaimed lieutenant-governor,
in order to hold the province for William and Mary until their pleasure
should be known. There was little ground for distrusting the Catholics
within the province; but the danger from the French was more real, and
took a shape that was not expected, in the murderous assault which was
made on Schenectady.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Leisler’s adherents, as well as his opponents, felt
that this <i>coup de main</i> of the French might be only the precursor of greater
disasters, if no precautionary steps were taken. Leisler himself believed
that the English colonies would never be safe unless the French were
driven from Canada. He called a congress of the colonies. Their deliberations
led to the naval expedition of Phips against Quebec, and the march
of Winthrop and Livingston against Montreal. Their disastrous failure has
been described in an earlier volume.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Governor Sloughter arrived in New
York a few months later, and soon put an end to the hasty revolt. Leisler
and his son-in-law, Milbourne, were hanged for what seemed an untimely
patriotism and still more uncalled-for religious zeal.</p>

<p>The cry was practically a “No Popery” cry upon which Leisler had risen
to such prominence in the affairs of New York. It had appeared scarcely
to attract the notice of the king, and he was prone to believe that Leisler
was more influenced by a hatred of the Established Church than by zeal for
the crown. It was not, however, without some effect. A few words added
to the instruction of the new governor had materially changed the condition
of religious toleration in the province. Earlier governors had been
directed “to permit all persons, of what religion soever, quietly to inhabit
within the government.” Under Governor Sloughter’s instructions papists
were excepted from this toleration. Was such intolerance really needed
for the safety of the English colonies? They had been so far in the main a
refuge for those who in Europe had suffered because of their liberal and
anti-Roman religious opinions, and had never been much sought by Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
The conditions of life in the colonies were hardly favorable to a
church which brands private reasoning as heresy; and even in Maryland&mdash;which
was established, if not as a Catholic colony, yet by a nobleman of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
faith&mdash;there were, after fifty years of existence, only about one hundred
Romanists. Public opinion and the political situation in England had now
raised this bugbear of popery. It was but the faint echo of the cry which
prompted those restrictions in the instructions to King William’s governor
which sought to enforce in New York the policy long in vogue in the
mother country. The home government seemed ignorant of the fact that
the natural enemies of the Church of Rome, the Reformed and Lutheran
clergymen of New York, had not only not shared Leisler’s fears, but, supported
by the better educated and wealthier classes, they had opposed him
by every means in their power. When, however, with Leisler’s death the
motive for their dislike of his cause had been removed, the general assembly,
composed to a great extent of his former opponents, willingly enacted
a law, the so-called Bill of Rights, denying “liberty to any person of the
Romish religion to exercise their manner of worship, contrary to the laws of
England.”<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> After the attempt on the life of King William in 1697, further
laws, expelling Roman Catholic priests and Jesuits from the province, and
depriving papists and popish recusants of their right to vote, were passed
in 1700 and 1701. It was reserved for the Revolution of 1776 to change
the legal status of the Roman Catholics of New York, and place them on
an equal footing with the believers in other doctrines.</p>

<p class="p2">In establishing the colony of Pennsylvania on the basis of religious freedom,
Penn declared that every Christian, without distinction of sect, should
be eligible to public employments. But on the accession of William and
Mary it became necessary to adopt and endorse the so-called “penal laws,”
in prosecuting followers of the elder church. Penn himself was unable to
prevent it, although his liberal spirit revolted at such intolerance, and it
seems that the authorities in Pennsylvania were quite as willing as their
chief to treat Romanists with liberality, notwithstanding the “penal laws,”
since in 1708 Penn was unfavorably criticised in England for the leniency
with which this sect was treated by him. “It has become a reproach,” he
writes to his friend Logan, “to me here with the officers of the crown, that
you have suffered the scandal of the mass to be publicly celebrated.”</p>

<p>Despite all laws, Pennsylvania became of all the colonies the most favorable
and the safest field for the priests and missionaries of the Church of
Rome. It is true, they had to travel about the country in disguise, but it
was known everywhere that Romanists from other provinces came to Philadelphia
or Lancaster at regular intervals to receive the sacraments according
to the rites of their faith. Before the Revolution, Pennsylvania harbored
five Catholic churches, with about double the number of priests and
several thousand communicants, mostly Irish and Germans.</p>

<p class="p2">The attempt upon the life of the king in 1697 had much the same effect
in East New Jersey as in New York. The law of 1698, “declaring what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
are the rights and privileges of his majesty’s subjects in East New Jersey,”
directed “that no person or persons that profess faith in God by Jesus
Christ, his only Son, shall at any time be molested, punished, disturbed, or
be called in question for difference in religious opinion, &amp;c., &amp;c., provided
this shall not extend to any of the Romish religion the right to exercise
their manner of worship contrary to the laws and statutes of England.”<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>When Lord Cornbury assumed the government of New Jersey in 1701,
his instructions directed him to permit liberty
of conscience to all persons except papists.
Matters remained thus with the Romish Church
in New Jersey until the end of British rule.</p>

<p class="p2">Another incident of Leisler’s brief administration
was of greater importance and farther-reaching
consequences than his proscription of
persons differing from his religious opinions. It
will be remembered<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> that a general assembly
of the province had been elected in 1683, holding two sessions that year
and another in 1684; also that it had been dissolved in 1687, pursuant to
the instructions of King James II. to Sir Edmond Andros, directing him
“to observe in the passing of lawes that the Stile of enacting the same by
the Governor and Council be henceforth used and no other.” The laws
enacted by the first assembly, and not repealed by the king, remained in
force, and the government was carried on with the revenues derived from
the excise on beer, wine, and liquors, from the customs duties on exported
and imported goods, and from tax levies; but the people had no voice in
the ordering of this revenue, as they had had none during the Dutch period
and before 1683. Leisler and his party, however, firmly believed in the
Aryan principle of “no taxation without representation,” and when a necessity
for money arose out of the French invasion and the subsequent
plan to reduce Canada, Leisler issued writs of election for a general assembly,
which in the first session, in April, 1690, enacted a law for raising
money by a general tax. Adjourned to the following autumn, it again
ordered another tax levy, and passed an act obliging persons to serve in
civil or military office.</p>

<p>In calling together this general assembly, notwithstanding the repeal by
James II. of the Charter of Liberties of 1683, Leisler assumed for the colony
of New York a right which the laws and customs of Great Britain did
not concede to her as a “conquered or crown” province. The terms on
which New York had been surrendered to the English, both in 1664 and in
1674, ignored a participation by the people in the administration of the
government, and the king in council could therefore, without infringing
upon any law of England or breaking any treaty stipulation, deal with the
conquered province as he pleased; while all the other colonies in America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
were “settled or discovered” countries, which, because taken possession of
as unoccupied lands or under special charters and settled by English subjects,
had thereby inherited the common law of England and all the rights
and liberties of Englishmen, subject only to certain conditions imposed by
their respective charters, as against the prerogatives of the crown. The action
of Leisler showed to the English ministry the injustice with which
New York had been treated so long, and the instructions given to Governor
Sloughter in November, 1690, directed him “to summon and call general
Assemblies of the Inhabitants, being Freeholders within your Government,
according to the usage of our other Plantations in America.” This general
assembly was to be the popular branch of the government, while the council,
appointed by the king upon the governor’s recommendation, took the
place of the English House of Lords. The governor had a negative voice
in the making of all laws, the final veto remaining with the king, to whom
every act had to be sent for confirmation. Three coördinate factors of the
government&mdash;the assembly, the council, and the governor&mdash;were now
established in theory; in reality there were only two, for the governor always
presided at the sessions of the council, voting as a member, and in
case of a tie gave also a casting vote. This state of affairs, by which the
executive branch possessed two votes on every legislative measure, as well
as the final approval, continued until 1733, when, Governor Cosby having
quarrelled with the chief justice and other members of the council, the
question was submitted to the home government. The law officers now declared
that it was inconsistent with the nature of the English government,
the governor’s commission, and his majesty’s instructions for the governor
in any case whatsoever to sit and vote as a member of the council. Governor
Cosby was therefore informed by the Lords of Trade and Plantations
that he could sit and advise with the council on executive business, but
not when the council met as a legislative body.</p>

<p>The first assembly called by Governor Sloughter enacted, in 1691, the
Bill of Rights, which was the Charter of Liberties of 1683, with some
modifications relative to churches. It met with the same fate as before,
as the Lords of Trade could not recommend it to the king for approval, because
it gave “great and unreasonable privileges” to the members of the
general assembly, and “contained also several large and doubtful expressions.”
The king accordingly vetoed it in 1697, after the ministry had
required six years to discover the objections against it. They could not
very well give the real reason, which was that this Bill of Rights vested supreme
power and authority, under the king, in the governor, council, and
the <i>people by their representatives</i>, while it was as yet undecided whether in
New York, a “conquered” province, the people had any right to demand
representation in the legislative bodies.</p>

         <p class="pf300">From a plate in Valentine’s <i>N. Y. City Manual</i>, 1851.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Governor Sloughter died within a few months after his arrival in New
York (June, 1691), and was succeeded by Colonel Benjamin Fletcher, “a
soldier, a man of strong passions and inconsiderable talent, very active and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
equally avaricious,” who, as his successor Bellomont said, allowed the introduction
into the province of a debased coinage (the so-called dog dollars);
protected pirates, and
took a share of their
booty as a reward for
his protection; misapplied
and embezzled
the king’s revenue
and other moneys
appropriated for special and public uses; gave away and took for himself,
for nominal quit-rents, extensive tracts of land; and used improper influence
in securing the election of his friends to the general assembly.</p>

<p>A man of such a character could hardly be a satisfactory governor of a
province, the inhabitants of which were still divided between the bitterly
antagonistic factions of Leislerians and anti-Leislerians, without in a short
time gaining the ill-will and enmity of one of them. The men whose official
position, as members of the council, gave them the first opportunity of
influencing the new governor were anti-Leislerians. Fletcher therefore
joined this party, without perhaps fully understanding the cause of the dissensions.
His lack of administrative abilities, coupled with his affiliation
with one party, gave sufficient cause to the other to make grave charges
against him, which resulted in his recall in 1697.</p>

<p>In the mean time the assembly had begun the struggle for legislative supremacy
which characterizes the inner political life of New York during
the whole period of British dominion.</p>

<p>It enacted two laws which were the principal source of all the party disputes
during the following decades. One of these laws established a revenue,
and thereby created a precedent which succeeding assemblies did
not always consider necessary to acknowledge, while the executive would
insist upon its being followed. The other erected courts of justice as a
temporary measure, and when they expired by limitation, and a later governor
attempted to erect a court without the assent of the assembly, this
law, too, was quoted as precedent, but was likewise ignored.</p>

<p>In 1694 the assembly discovered that, during the last three years, a
revenue of £40,000 had been provided for, which had generally been
misapplied. Governor Fletcher refused to account for it, as, according to
his ideas of government, the assembly’s business was only to raise money
for the governor and council to spend. This resulted in a dissolution of
the assembly, as in the council’s judgment “there was no good to be expected
from this assembly,” and very little was done by its successor,
elected in 1695. But not satisfied with vetoing the Bill of Rights, the home
authorities tried further to repress the growing liberal movement in New
York by giving to Fletcher’s successor, the Earl of Bellomont, an absolute
negative on the acts of the provincial legislature, so that no infringement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
upon the prerogatives of the crown might become a law. He was further
empowered to prorogue the assembly, to institute courts, appoint judges,
and disburse the revenues. The Bishop of London was made the head of
all ecclesiastical and educational matters in the province, and no printing-press
was allowed to be put up without the governor’s license.</p>

<p>Bellomont, in addressing the first assembly under his administration,
made a bid for popular favor by finding fault with the doings of his predecessor,
who had left him as a legacy “difficulties to struggle with, a divided
people, an empty treasury, a few miserable, naked, half-starved soldiers,
being not half the number the king allowed pay for, the fortifications, and
even the governor’s house, very much out of repairs, and, in a word, gentlemen
(he said), the whole government out of frame.” The assembly was
to find remedies, that is, money wherewith to repair all these evils. How
they did it is shown by a speech made to them by Bellomont a month
later: “You have now sat a whole month ... and have done nothing,
either for the service of his Majestie or the good of y<sup>e</sup> country.... Your
proceedings have been so unwarrantable, wholy tending to strife and division,
and indeed disloyal to his Majestie and his laws, and destructive to the
rights and libertys of the people, that I do think fit to <i>dissolve</i> this present
assembly, and it is <i>dissolved</i> accordingly.”</p>

<p>Having come with the best intentions of curing the evils of Fletcher’s
rule, and being instructed to break up piracy, of which New York had been
represented in England as the very hot-bed, Bellomont soon became popular,
and no doubt grew in favor with the people, both by persuading the
assembly to enact a law of indemnity for Leisler, whose body, with that
of Milbourne, was now granted the honors of a public reinterment, and
by bringing Kidd, the celebrated sea-rover, to justice. To-day that which
was meted out to Kidd might hardly be called justice; for it seems questionable
if he had ever been guilty of piracy.</p>

<p>Bellomont was not allowed to carry out his plans for the internal improvement
of the province, for death put an end to his work at the end of
the third year of his administration, in 1701. His successor, Lord Cornbury,
who entered upon his duties early in 1702 (Lieutenant-Governor Nanfan
having had meanwhile a successful contest with the leaders of the still
vigorous anti-Leisler party), was sent out as governor by his cousin, Queen
Anne, in order to retrieve his shattered fortune. The necessitous condition
in which he arrived in New York and his profligate mode of life
soon led him to several misappropriations of public funds, which resulted
in a law, passed by the disgusted assembly of 1705, taking into their own
hands the appointment of a provincial treasurer for the receipt and disbursement
of all public moneys. The whole of Cornbury’s administration
was occupied with a contest between the assembly and the crown: the
former claiming all the privileges of Englishmen under Magna Charta;
the latter, through its governor, maintaining its prerogatives, and saying
that the assembly had no other rights and privileges “but such as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
queen is pleased to allow.” Lord Cornbury’s recall did not mend matters.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
The assembly of 1708, the last under Cornbury’s administration, had been
dissolved, because in its tenacity of the people’s right it had declared that
to levy money in the colony without consent of the general assembly was
a grievance and a violation of the people’s
property; that the erecting of a court of equity
without consent of the general assembly
was contrary to law, both without precedent
and of dangerous consequences to the liberty
and properties of the subjects.</p>

</div>

<p>The term of
Cornbury’s successor, Lord Lovelace, was very short, death calling him off
within six months, while the lieutenant-governor, Ingoldsby, was a man too
much like his friends, Sloughter, Fletcher, and Cornbury, to improve the
state of affairs. With Governor Robert Hunter’s commission there came,
in 1710, the answer to the declaration of the assembly of 1708. He received
thereby “full power and authority to erect, constitute, and establish
courts of judicature, with the advice and consent of the council.” The
assembly’s remonstrance had been met by ignoring its author, and this
treatment naturally incensed the representatives
of the people so much that all
the efforts of Governor Hunter, a man
of excellent qualities, the friend of Addison
and Swift, availed nothing in the
way of settling the existing differences.</p>

<p>After two years’ administration, Governor
Hunter had to confess to the Lords
of Trade that he could not expect any
support of the government from the assembly,
“unless her Majesty will be
pleased to put it entirely into their own
hands;” and in 1715 he appointed Lewis
Morris, a wealthy man, as successor to
the deceased Chief Justice Mompesson,
“because he is able to live without
salary, which they [the assembly] will
most certainly never grant to any in
that station.” He found that he could not carry on the government without
yielding, and thereby acting contrary to his instructions, and during the
summer of 1715 came to an understanding with the assembly. “I asked,”
he says, in a letter to the Lords of Trade, “what they would do for the Government
if I should pass it (the Naturalization Bill) in their way, since they
did not like mine; I asked nothing for myself, tho’ they well knew that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
had offers of several thousands of pounds for my assent; they at last
agreed that they would settle a sufficient Revenue for the space of five
years on that condition; many rubs I met with, but at last with difficulty
carry’d through both parts of the Legislature and assented to both at the
same time. If I have done amiss, I am sorry for’t, but what was there left
for me to do? I have been struggling hard for bread itself for five years
to no effect and for four of them unpitty’d, I hope I have now laid a foundation
for a lasting settlement on this hitherto unsettled and ungovernable
Province.”</p>

<p>In asserting their rights as representatives of the <i>people</i> and compelling
the executive finally to acknowledge them, the assembly had followed the
course which has been shown to be effective in the English Parliament
since the days of William III. But the legislative supremacy over the
executive established by this victory was greater than that obtained by
Parliament. In New York the executive could only collect taxes when first
authorized by the legislature, while the people, through their representatives,
kept the control of the sums collected in their own hands by appointing
the receiving and disbursing officers.</p>

<p>Hunter’s wise course in yielding on several points had a better effect on
the province than at first he was willing to confess. Fletcher had found
the people of New York “generally very poor and the government much
in debt, occasioned by the mismanagement of those who have exercised the
King’s power.” The revenues of the province were in such deplorable
condition that several sums of money had to be borrowed on the personal
credit of members of the council to pay the most pressing debts of government;
the burden of war, unjustly placed on the shoulders of New York,
had impoverished the inhabitants and almost destroyed their usefulness
as taxpayers; while the neighboring colonies, either refusing to assist in
the defence of the frontiers against the French or being dilatory in sending
their quota of money and men, reaped the advantage of New York’s patriotism
by receiving within their boundaries the bulk of the foreign trade,
and by adding to their population the majority of emigrants. When Hunter
left the province, after ten years’ service as its governor, he could congratulate
the assembly on increased prosperity and on a better state of
public affairs.</p>

<p>His successor was the comptroller of customs at London, William Burnet,
the son of the celebrated bishop, who exchanged places with Hunter.
Smith, the historian, describes him as “a man of sense and polite breeding,
a well-read scholar, sprightly and of social disposition.... He used to
say of himself, ‘I act first and think afterwards.’” The good reports
which preceded Burnet made a favorable impression on the colonial assembly,
and the whole period of his administration was undisturbed by constitutional
disputes, even though people opposed to him tried to create
trouble by asserting that the appointment of a new governor of the province
required, like the accession of a new king, the election of a new assembly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and by representing the continuance of an assembly under two
governors as unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Burnet’s distrust of the neighboring French caused some stir in mercantile
circles. He had an act passed forbidding all trade in Indian goods
with Canada,&mdash;an act which would have benefited the province in general
by securing all the Indian trade, a large part of which now found its way
to Canada; but the merchants of New York and Albany, who disposed of
their surplus to Canada traders, would have made less profits. They consequently
opposed Burnet’s plans until the end of his administration (1728).</p>

<p>During the three years of John Montgomerie’s rule, which was ended by
his death, in 1731, New York enjoyed some rest, to be violently disturbed,
however, by the claims of his successor. It had been usual in the royal
instructions of the governor to fix the salary of the president of the council
at half the amount allowed to the executive, and it was customary to provide
that in the absence, resignation, or death of the governor or lieutenant-governor
he should assume the reins
of the government. Upon Montgomerie’s
death, Rip van Dam, as eldest member
of the council, became president, and then claimed the full salary of the
governor, which the council, after five months’ deliberation, finally allowed.
It was upon this decision that the famous Zenger libel suit of a few years
later hinged. Soon after the arrival of the new governor, William Cosby,
Rip van Dam was called upon (November, 1732) to restore to the treasury a
moiety of the full salary, which, under the decision of the council, he had
been receiving in contravention, as was claimed, of the royal instructions.
On the refusal of the president to comply, the attorney-general of the province
was directed to begin an action in the king’s name “to the enforcing
a Due Complyance with the said Order [to refund] according to the true
Intent thereof and of his Majestie’s Additional Instruction.”</p>

<p>At the trial, the chief justice, Lewis Morris, surprised the governor, the
attorney-general, and the whole aristocratic party (Van Dam and his friends
representing the popular party) by informing the king’s counsel, in the
first place, that the question to be discussed was one of jurisdiction, involving
the right of the court to decide cases of equity; and in the second place,
that he denied such jurisdiction, and in general the right of the king to
establish courts of equity.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Jealous to maintain the royal prerogatives,
Cosby removed Morris from the chief-justiceship, and put De Lancey, the
second justice, in his place. Finding his efforts to be reinstated without
result, and having no other means to avenge himself, Morris had recourse
to the press, and in <i>Zenger’s New York Weekly Journal</i> he attacked the
governor with extreme rancor, and attempted to influence the general assembly,
to which he had been elected, against the king’s authority to erect
courts. Even Cosby’s death, in 1736, could not conciliate him. The attacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
upon his administration continued, and Morris’s vindictiveness finally
even disturbed the council and the assembly. President Clarke, who had
temporarily succeeded Cosby, was deterred from arresting Van Dam, the
younger Morris, Smith the historian, and Zenger the printer, to be sent
to England to be tried for treason, only because the forty-fifth paragraph of
the instructions required positive proof of the crime in such cases.</p>

<p>The trial of Zenger had, however, already shown that it was not safe to
accuse a man of a crime when a jury had already acquitted him. The first
number of the <i>Weekly Journal</i> appeared on the 5th of November, 1733;
and its editor had from the beginning made war upon the administration
with so much vigor that in January following the chief justice, De Lancey,
“was pleased to animadvert upon the doctrine of libel in a long charge
given in that term to the grand jury,”<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> hoping to obtain an indictment
against Zenger. The jury did not share the opinions of the chief justice,
and failed to indict Zenger. Nor was the general assembly willing to concur
in a subsequent resolution of the council that certain numbers of the
<i>Journal</i> should be publicly burnt by the hangman, “as containing in them
many things derogatory of the dignity of his majesty’s government, reflecting
upon the legislature and tending to raise seditions and tumults in
the province,” and that the printer should be prosecuted. The burning
of the papers (November 2, 1734), carried out by special order of the council
alone, was in appearance far from the solemn judicial act which it was
meant to be. The sheriff and the recorder of New York, with a few friends,
stood around the pile, while the sheriff’s negro, not the official hangman,
set fire to it. The municipal authorities, who usually have to attend such
ceremonies <i>ex officio</i>, and were ordered to do so in this case, had refused to
come, and would not even allow the order to be entered in the proper records,
because they considered it to be neither a royal mandatory writ nor
an order authorized by law. Zenger’s trial began on the 4th of August,
and resulted in a verdict of “Not guilty.”</p>

<p>The publishing of the alleged libel had been admitted, but it was claimed
to be neither false, nor scandalous, nor malicious. When the New York lawyers
who had been engaged in the defence were disbarred, Andrew Hamilton,
a prominent pleader from Philadelphia, took the case. He managed it
so adroitly, met the browbeating of De Lancey so courageously, and pleaded
the cause of his client so eloquently that he at once achieved a more conspicuous
fame than belonged to any other practitioner at the bar of that
day. The corporation of New York fell in with the popular applause in
conferring upon him the freedom of their city, enclosing their seal in a box
of gold, while they added the “assurances of the great esteem that the
corporation had for his person and merits.”<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The result of Zenger’s trial established the freedom of the press in the
colonies,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> for it settled here the right of juries to find a general verdict in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
libel cases, as was done in England by a law of Parliament passed many
years later, and it took out of the hands of judges appointed to serve during
the king’s pleasure, and not during good behavior, as in England, the power
to do mischief.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> It also gave a finishing blow to the Court of Exchequer,
which, after the case of Cosby <i>versus</i> Van Dam, never again exercised an
equity jurisdiction, and it suppressed the royal prerogative in an assumed
right to establish courts without consulting the legislature. The jurisdiction
hitherto exercised by the Supreme Court as a Court of Exchequer&mdash;that
is, in all matters relating to his majesty’s lands, rights, rents, profits, and
revenues&mdash;had always been called in question by colonial lawyers, because
no act of the general assembly countenanced it. It was, therefore, a relief
to everybody in the province when the legislature, in 1742, passed an “Act
for regulating the payment of the Quit-Rents,” which in effect, though not
in name, established on a firm basis a branch of the Supreme Court as a
Court of Exchequer. As then instituted, it passed into the courts of the
state, and was only abolished in December, 1828.</p>

<p>The excitement over the Zenger trial had hardly had time to subside
when Rip van Dam again disturbed the public mind by claiming, after
Cosby’s death, that he as eldest councillor was entitled to be president of
the council, and as such to be acting governor, although he had been removed
from the council by Cosby. Before the quarrel could attain too
threatening dimensions, Clarke’s commission as lieutenant-governor happily
arrived, and Van Dam’s claim was set at rest. Clarke’s administration
of the province was in the main a satisfactory one. He had lived nearly
half a century in New York,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> and was thoroughly conversant with its resources
and its needs, and, assisted by a good education as a lawyer, he
found little difficulty in managing the refractory assembly and in gaining
most of his important legislative points. His greatest victory was that by
certain concessions he induced the assembly of 1739 to grant again a revenue
to the king equivalent to the civil list in England, which had been
refused since 1736, but was continued during the whole of Clarke’s administration.
Although perhaps never unmindful of his own interests, he had
also the good of the province at heart, and it must be regretted that a plan,
drawn up while he was yet secretary, for colonizing the Indian country
was not fully carried out and bore no fruits. He proposed to buy from the
Iroquois about 100,000 acres of land, the purchase money to be raised
either by subscription or by the issue of bills of credit. Every Protestant
family made acquainted with the conditions and wishing to settle was to
have 200 acres at nominal quit-rents. All the officials who were entitled
to fees from the issue of land patents agreed to surrender the same, so that
it would have imposed upon the settlers only the cost of improvements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
The neighboring colonies had industriously spread the report that there
were few or no lands ungranted in the province of New York, and that the
expense of purchasing the remainder from the Indians or obtaining a grant
from the crown was greater than the price of land in Pennsylvania and
other colonies. Advertisements were therefore to be scattered over Europe,
giving intending emigrants a clear view of the advantages of settling
in the backwoods of New York. The plan reads very much like a modern
land-scheme. If it could, however, have been carried out in those days,
with all the governmental machinery to help it, the country from the upper
Mohawk to the Genesee would have been settled before the Revolution,
and Sullivan’s expedition might have become unnecessary and a Cherry
Valley massacre impossible.</p>

<p>The only great event of Clarke’s administration was the negro plot of
1741, which for a while cast the city of New York into a state of fear and
attendant precautions, and these conditions were felt even throughout the
colonies. A close examination of the testimony given at the trial of the
alleged negro conspirators fails to convince the modern investigator that
the slaves, who had been misled by the counsels of Roman Catholics, had
really arranged a plan to murder all the whites and burn the city. Fires
had occurred rather frequently, suspiciously so, during the spring of 1741,
the negro riot of the earlier years of the century was remembered, reports
of negro insurrections in the West Indies made slave-owners look askance
at their ebony chattels, an invasion of the British colonies in America by
France and Spain seemed imminent, and a rancorous hatred of the Church
of Rome and its adherents prevailed among the English and Dutch inhabitants
of New York, while tradition and the journal of the proceedings against
the conspirators assure us that some sort of a plot existed; but we must
still wonder at the panic occasioned among the ten or twelve thousand
white inhabitants by what, after all, may have been only the revengeful acts
of a few of the 20 whites and 154 negroes who were indicted on the most
insufficient evidence. It is doubtful whether all who were indicted had
anything to do with the fires or the intended murder, but the judicial proceedings
were of a nature to implicate every one of the two thousand colored
people in the county of New York, and two thirds of the accused
were found guilty, and were either hanged, burnt at the stake, or transported.</p>

<p>Political astuteness, or perhaps a desire to enjoy in quiet his advancing
years, had led Clarke to yield to the popular party on all important points.
He had confined himself to wordy remonstrances in surrendering several
of his prerogatives. His successor, Admiral George Clinton,&mdash;the second
son of the Earl of Lincoln, and, as he acknowledged himself, a friend and
cousin of Charles Clinton, father of Governor George Clinton of a later
date,&mdash;found that the position of governor had ceased to be financially
desirable. New Jersey had been again placed under a separate governor,
thus reducing the income of the governor of New York by £1,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
“Former governors,” it is reported, “had the advantage of one of the
four companies, besides the paying of all the four companies, which made
at least £2,000 per annum;”
but now the assembly had
placed this in other hands.</p>

</div></div>

<p>They had also interfered
with a former custom, according
to which the governors
drew one half of their
salary from the date of their
commissions; but under the
new arrangement for raising
and paying the salary
he could only draw it from
the date of his arrival. Clinton
brought with him a prejudice
against his lieutenant-governor
which was perhaps
justified, for he knew him
to have led Cosby into all
the errors which characterized the latter’s administration. But instead of
maintaining an independent position apart from the two political parties,
he threw himself into the arms of the cunning Chief Justice De Lancey,
the leader of the popular faction. Acting under his advice, Clinton at
first was as ready to yield every point to the assembly as Clarke had
done, until he discovered that all the powers of a governor were gradually
slipping into De Lancey’s hand, who hoped to tire out Clinton’s
patience and induce him to resign, thus leaving the field free to him
with a commission of lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>Clinton, upon his arrival at New York, had found, as Clarke predicted,
the province “in great tranquillity and in a flourishing condition, able to
support the government in an ample and honorable manner.” He perhaps
would have had no difficulty with the general assembly about money grants,
if he had been less distrustful of Clarke and more willing to acknowledge
the rights of the people in such matters. His first measures of dissolving
the old assembly, calling a new one, and, perhaps for the first time in
America, introducing a kind of civil service reform by continuing in place
all officers who had been appointed by his predecessors, were received with
great satisfaction throughout the province, but they failed to loosen the
strings of the public purse, while the new assembly sought other measures
to declare their independence. Clarke’s advice, given before Clinton’s arrival,
that henceforth the assembly should allow the government a revenue
for a term of years, was not acted upon; but instead they voted the usual
appropriations for one year only. In voting salaries for officers, they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
not recognize the incumbents by name, and the council pronounced this a
device of the assembly to usurp the appointing power, and to change the
stipends of the officers at any time.</p>

<p>Walpole had meanwhile turned over the government in England to his
friend Pelham, a family connection of Governor Clinton. Macaulay describes
Pelham as a man with an understanding like that of Walpole, “on a
somewhat smaller scale.” During Pelham’s administration, a bill was considered
in the House of Commons in 1744, news of which, upon reaching
the colonies, did not fail to arouse their indignation. It forbade the American
colonies to issue bills of credit or paper money. As these colonies had
but little trade, and had to draw upon Europe for the tools and necessaries
of life in the newly opened wilderness, the small amount of coin which they
received from the West Indies and the Spanish main in exchange for
bread-stuffs and lumber, their only articles of exportation, went across the
ocean in part payment of their debts, leaving no “instrument of association,”
no circulating medium, in their hands. To replace the coin, they
had to have recourse to the issue of paper money, without which all intercolonial
and internal trade would have been impossible. The parliamentary
intention of depriving the colonies of these means of exchange led the
New York assembly to declare that the bill was contrary to the constitution
of Great Britain, inconsistent with the liberties and privileges of Englishmen,
and subjected the British colonies in America to the absolute will
of the crown and its officers.</p>

<p>The efforts of Governor Clinton to reconcile the assembly by giving his
assent to all the bills passed by them in their first session did not prevent
their assuming greater powers than the House of Commons. He could not
obtain from them either money or men for the Cape Breton expedition, set
on foot by Governor Shirley of Massachusetts. Trying to regain control
of colonial politics, he stirred up a bitter feeling among the popular party
men; and after years of struggle, during which the home government afforded
him little comfort and support, Clinton was willing to throw up his
commission as governor of New York in 1751, and return to England and
resume his station as admiral.</p>

<p>The French of Canada had used many artifices and had been indefatigable
in their endeavors to gain over the Six Nations. They had cajoled
many of them to desert their own tribes and remove to Canada, and had
instigated others, whom they could induce to desert, to go to war with the
Catawba Indians, friends of South Carolina, thereby endangering and weakening
the allegiance of the Southern Indians to the British interest. Commissioners
had arrived, or were to come, from all the other colonies, to
meet the Six Nations at Albany and renew the covenant chain. If Quidor
(the Indian name for the governor of New York) were to be absent on such
an occasion, especially a Quidor who already had made an excellent impression
on the king’s red allies, the council conceived that the meeting
would not only be without result, but that the Indians, considering themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
slighted, would turn a more willing ear to the French, and thus endanger
the existence of the colonies. Clinton was luckily a man who considered
duty higher than any personal comfort, and on the 1st of July, 1751, opened
the conference with the Indians which may be said to have been one of
the most important in the history of the English colonies. Colonel William
Johnson was induced to withdraw his resignation as Indian agent,
which had made the Six Nations very uneasy, and a peace was made between
the Iroquois, of New York, and the Catawbas, which also included
their friends among the Southern Indians. There is not space to say
much of the Indian policy pursued by Governor Clinton and other royal
governors of New York. To use the Indian explanation, “they took example
from the sun, which has its regular course; and as the sun is certain
in its motion, New York was certain to the Indians in the course of their
mutual affairs, and deviated not in the least.” New York alone had to bear
the expenses (£1,150) of this conference, since Massachusetts, Connecticut,
and South Carolina refused to contribute, while New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
and Virginia were not represented. The other colonies also refused
to help New York in keeping the Iroquois in good humor by supplying
smiths to live in the Indian territory and repair the savages’ guns and
hatchets. New York has the benefit of the Indian trade, they said; let
her bear the burden. Pennsylvania, most interested of all the middle colonies
in keeping the Indians friendly, had soon learned the evils of neglecting
them. Armed parties of French and savages came down into the valley
of the Ohio in 1753, creating great confusion among the Indians of
Pennsylvania, and inducing nearly all, the Delawares alone excepted, to
join the French, as their best recourse in the indifference of the English.
At the same time the New York Indians became dissatisfied at their
treatment by the general assembly, which would not allow the forts in the
Indian country, at Oswego and at Albany, to be maintained, preferring to
trust to the activity of the Indians for keeping the French and their savage
allies from devastating the northern frontier. Disgusted with the constant
struggle which the jealousy of the assembly and their encroachments upon
the royal prerogatives always kept alive, Clinton finally resigned in October
of 1753; astonishing the council, and especially his political enemy De Lancey,
the chief justice, before he surrendered the office to his newly arrived
successor, Sir Danvers Osborn, by the production of a letter from the
Duke of Newcastle, secretary of state, dated October 27, 1747, which gave
Clinton a leave of absence to come to England, and covered De Lancey’s
commission as lieutenant-governor. This stroke of Clinton’s did not succeed
very well. It is true, Sir Danvers’ presence deprived the new lieutenant-governor
of the pleasure of showing himself as chief magistrate of the
province, but it was to be only for a few days. Sir Danvers, perceiving
that the assembly of New York was not a body easily led by royal commands,
exclaimed, “What have I come here for?” and hanged himself two
days after taking the necessary oath; and thus the lieutenant-governor, De
Lancey, came into power.</p>

<p>De Lancey soon discovered himself in a dilemma. The oaths which he
had taken when entering upon his new office, and which he must have
had self-respect enough to consider binding, compelled him to maintain
the royal prerogatives and several
obnoxious laws made for the colonies
by Parliament. On the other
side, his political career and his
bearing of past years forced him to
work for the continuation of the
popularity which his opposition to
the very things he had sworn to do
had gained him. De Lancey was
skilful enough to avoid both horns
of this dilemma. The assembly,
rejoicing to see a man of their
own thinking at the head of affairs,
passed money and other laws in accordance with the lieutenant-governor’s
suggestions, and quietly pocketed his rebukes, when he saw fit to administer
any. The two most important events during his term were of such a
nature that he could do nothing, or only very little, to prevent or further
action.</p>

<p>On the 11th of January, 1754, a great number of people assembled in
the city of New York, on account of a late agreement of the merchants and
others not to receive or pass copper half-pence in payment at any other
rate than fourteen to the shilling. The crowd kept increasing until two
o’clock in the afternoon, when the arrest of the man beating the drum and
of two others throwing half-pence into the mass quieted them.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Later there was the conference of commissioners of all the colonies at
Albany in July, 1754, convened to treat anew with the Iroquois, and also
to consider, in obedience to orders from England, a plan of confederation for
all the colonies. The deliberations and conclusions of the congress in this
last respect are made the subject of inquiry in a later chapter of the present
volume.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> De Lancey was accused of opposing this plan of union by
his machinations. We may say that such accusation was unjust. The
general assembly of the province, to whom the “representation of the state
and plan for union” was referred, that they might make observations thereupon,
said in their report or address to the lieutenant-governor, on the 22d
of August, 1754: “We are <i>of opinion with your Honor</i>, that nothing is
more natural and salutary than a union of the colonies for their own defence.”
While he transmitted the minutes of the congress at Albany to
the Lords of Trade without a word of comment, he may have used his private
influence to defeat the union; but there is no reason to believe that he
acted even in that wise from other than upright motives, and he had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
shown, in the New Jersey boundary question, how personal associations
had restrained him from interfering or giving an opinion. His sense of
duty in office was perhaps exaggerated, and he could not brook censure by
the home authorities. The receiver-general and other officers entrusted
with the collection of the king’s revenue desired the passage of an act
“for the more easy collecting his majesty’s quit-rents, and for protection
of land in order thereto.” The assembly and council having passed such a
bill, it came before the governor
for his assent, which he readily
gave, supposing that an act favored
by the king’s officers could
not meet with the disapproval of
the government in England. The
Lords of Trade, however, rebuked
him, and he sent in his resignation.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the appointment of Admiral Sir Charles
Hardy as governor had relieved
De Lancey for a time (1755-57)
from the cares of the administration.
Sir Charles allowed himself
to be led by his lieutenant-governor, and therefore the affairs of government
went on as smoothly as of late, excepting that the assembly made
occasional issues upon
money bills, though
that body was little inclined
to press their
levelling principles
too strongly against
their old friend, the
lieutenant-governor,
now that he was the
adviser of the executive.
Sir Charles
proved less fond of
the cares of office than
of the sea, and after
two years’ service resigned,
to hoist his blue admiral’s flag under Rear Admiral Holbourn at
Halifax. De Lancey had therefore to assume once more the government
on the 3d of June, 1757, which he administered, with little to disturb the
relations between the crown and the assembly, down to the time of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
death, on July 30, 1760. This event placed his lifelong adversary, Cadwallader
Colden, in the executive chair, first as president of the council, and a
year later as lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>The policy of the royal representative was now very quickly changed.
The acquiescent bearing of De Lancey in his methods with the assembly
gave place to the more peremptory manner which had been used by Clinton,
whose friend Colden had always been. The records of the next few
years, during which Monckton, who was connected with the Acadian deportation,
was governor, show but the beginning of that struggle between
prerogative and the people which resulted in the American Revolution,
and a consideration of the immediate causes of that contest belongs to
another volume.</p>

<p class="p2">The history of Pennsylvania, down to the appointment of Governor
Blackwell in 1688, has been told in a previous chapter.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The selection of
John Blackwell for the governorship was an unfortunate one. A son-in-law
of the Cromwellian General Lambert and a resident of puritanical
New England, he must have shared more or less in the hatred of the
Friends’ religion, so that his appointment to govern a colony settled principally
by this sect most likely arose from Penn’s respect and friendship
for the man and from his inability to find a suitable Quaker willing to
accept the office. Within two months after his arrival, he had quarrelled
with his predecessor, Thomas Lloyd, then keeper of the broad seal, and
the rest of the council. Shortly after this he succeeded in breaking up
the assembly, and before he had been in the province one year he became
convinced that his ideas of governing did not meet with the approbation
of the people, and returned to England, leaving the administration in the
hands of his opponent, Lloyd.</p>

<p>After having acquired from the Duke of York the Delaware territory,
Penn endeavored to bring his province and the older settlements under
one form of government; but he could not prevent the jealousies, caused
often by difference of religious opinion and by desire for offices, from raising
a conflict which soon after Blackwell’s departure threatened a dissolution
of the nominal union. Lloyd remained president of Pennsylvania,
while Penn’s cousin, Markham, was made lieutenant-governor of Delaware,
under certain restrictions, as detailed in a letter from Penn, which still
left the supremacy to Lloyd in matters of governing for the proprietary.</p>

<p>In the mean time James II. of England had been forced to give up his
crown to his son-in-law, and this event brought unexpected results to the
proprietary of Pennsylvania. Penn’s intimacy with the dethroned Stuart,
unmarred by their different religious views, made him at once a suspicious
person in the eyes of the new rulers of England. He had been arrested
three times on the charges of disaffection to the existing government, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
corresponding with the late king, and of adhering to the enemies of the
kingdom, but had up to 1690 always succeeded in clearing himself before
the Lords of the Council or the Court of King’s Bench. At last he was
allowed to make preparations for another visit to his province “with a
great company of adventurers,” when another order for his arrest necessitated
his retirement into the country, where he lived quietly for two or
three years. This blow came at a most critical time for his province,
distracted as it was by political and religious disturbances, which his
presence might have done much to prevent. The necessity of keeping
remote from observation did not give him opportunity to answer the complaints
which became current in England, that a schism among the Quakers
had inaugurated a system of religious intolerance in a province founded on
the principles of liberty of conscience. The result of this inopportune
but enforced inactivity on Penn’s part was to deprive him of his province
and its dependency (Delaware), and a commission was issued to Benjamin
Fletcher, then governor of New York, to take them under his government,
October 21, 1692. Fletcher made a visit to his new territory, hoping, perhaps,
that his appearance might bring the opposing sections into something
like harmony. Quickly disabused of his fond fancy, and disappointed
in luring money from the Quakers, he returned to New York, leaving a
deputy in charge. About the same time, 1694, Penn had obtained a
hearing before competent authority in England, and having cleared himself
successfully of all charges, he was reinvested with his proprietary rights.
Not able to return to Pennsylvania immediately, he transferred his authority
to Markham, who continued to act as ruler of the colony until 1699, when
Penn visited his domain once more.</p>

<p>One of Penn’s first acts was to impress the assembly with the necessity
of discouraging illicit trade and suppressing piracy. He did it with so
much success that the assembly not only passed two laws to this effect,
but also took a further step to clear the government of Pennsylvania from
all imputations by expelling one of its members, James Brown, a son-in-law
of Governor Markham, who was more or less justly accused of piracy. He
was equally successful with his recommendations to the assembly concerning
a new charter, the slave-trade, and the treatment and education of the
negroes already in the province. But when, in 1701, he asked in the
king’s name for a contribution of £350 towards the fortifications on the
frontiers of New York, the assembly decided to refer the consideration of
this matter to another meeting, or “until more emergent occasions shall
require our further proceedings therein.”</p>

<p>The evident intention of the ministry in England to reduce the proprietary
governments in the English colonies to royal ones, “under pretence
of advancing the prerogatives of the crown,” compelled Penn to
return to England in the latter part of 1701. But before he could leave a
quarrel broke out in the assembly between the deputies from the Lower
Counties, now Delaware, and those of the province. The former were accused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of having obtained some exclusive powers or rights for themselves
which the others would not allow them, and in consequence the men of the
Lower Counties withdrew from the assembly in high dudgeon. After long
discussions, and by giving promises to agree to a separation of that district
from the province under certain conditions, Penn at last managed to patch
up a peace between the two factions. He then went to England.</p>

<p>The new charter for the province and territories, signed by Penn, October
25, 1701, was more republican in character than those of the neighboring
colonies. It not only provided for an assembly of the people with
great powers, including those of creating courts, but to a certain extent it
submitted to the choice of the people the nomination of some of the county
officers. The section concerning liberty of conscience did not discriminate
against the members of the Church of Rome. The closing section fulfilled
the promise already made by Penn, that in case the representatives of the
two territorial districts could not agree within three years to join in legislative
business, the Lower Counties should be separated from Pennsylvania.
On the same day Penn established by letters-patent a council of
state for the province, “to consult and assist the proprietary himself or
his deputy with the best of their advice and council in public affairs and
matters relating to the government and the peace and well-being of the
people; and in the absence of the proprietary, or upon the deputy’s absence
out of the province, his death, or other incapacity, to exercise all
and singular the powers of government.” The original town and borough
of Philadelphia, having by this time “become near equal to the city of
New York in trade and riches,”<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> was raised, by patent of the 25th of
October, 1701, to the rank of a city, and, like the province, could boast of
having a more liberal charter than her neighbors; for the municipal officers
were to be elected by the representatives of the people of the city, and
not appointed by the governor, as in New York.</p>

<p>The government of the province had been entrusted by Penn to Andrew
Hamilton, also governor for the proprietors in New Jersey, with James
Logan as provincial secretary, to whom was likewise confided the management
of the proprietary estates, thus making him in reality the representative
of Penn and the leader of his party. Hamilton died in December,
1702; but before his death he had endeavored in vain to bring the representatives
of the two sections of his government together again. The
Delaware members remained obstinate, and finally, while Edward Shippen,
a member of the council and first mayor of Philadelphia, was acting as
president, it was settled that they should have separate assemblies, entirely
independent of each other.</p>

<p>The first separate assembly for Pennsylvania proper met at Philadelphia,
in October, 1703, and by its first resolution showed that the Quakers, so
dominant in the province, were beginning to acquire a taste for authority,
and meant to color their religion with the hue of political power. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to the new charter, the assembly, elected annually, was to consist of
four members for each county, and was to meet at Philadelphia on the
14th of October of each year, sitting upon their own adjournments. Upon
the separation of the legislative bodies of the two sections, Pennsylvania
claimed to be entitled to eight members for each county, which, being
duly elected and met, reasserted the powers granted by the charter; but
when the governor and council desired to confer with them they would
adjourn without conference. Upon the objection from the governor that
they could not sit wholly upon their own adjournment, they immediately
decided not to sit again until the following March, and thus deprive the
governor and council of every chance to come to an understanding on the
matter.</p>

<p>Before President Shippen could take any step toward settling this question,
John Evans, a young Welshman, lately appointed deputy-governor by
Penn, arrived in Philadelphia (December, 1703). The new-comer at once
called both assemblies together, directing them to sit in Philadelphia in
April, 1704, in utter disregard of the agreement of separation. He renewed
Hamilton’s efforts to effect again a legislative union, and also failed, not
because the Delaware members were opposed to it, but because now the
Pennsylvania representatives, probably disgusted with the obstinacy of the
former, absolutely refused to have anything to do with them. Governor
Evans took this refusal very ill and resented it in various ways, by which
the state of affairs was brought to such a pass that neither this nor the
next assembly, under the speakership of David Lloyd, accomplished anything
of importance, but complained bitterly to Penn of his deputy. In the
latter part of the same year the first assembly for the Lower Counties met
in the old town of New Castle, and was called upon by Governor Evans
to raise a militia out of that class of the population who were not prevented
by religious scruples from bearing arms,&mdash;soldiers being then needed for
the war against France and Spain. About a year later, having become
reconciled with the Pennsylvania assembly of 1706, Evans persuaded the
Delaware representatives to pass a law “for erecting and maintaining a
fort for her Majesty’s service at the Town of New Castle upon Delaware.”
This law exacted a toll in gunpowder from every vessel coming from the
sea up the river.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>These quarrels between the governor and the assemblies were repeated
every year. At one time they had for ground the refusal of the Quakers to
support the war which was waging against the French and Indians on the
frontiers. At another they disagreed upon the establishment of a judiciary.
These disturbances produced financial disruptions, and Penn himself
suffered therefrom to such an extent that he was thrown into a London
prison, and had finally to mortgage his province for £6,600. The recall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Evans, in 1709, and the appointment of Charles Gookin in his stead, did
not mend matters. Logan, Penn’s intimate friend and representative, was
finally compelled to leave the country; and, going to England (1710), he
induced Penn to write a letter to the Pennsylvania assembly, in which he
threatened to sell the province to the crown, a surrender by which he was
to receive £12,000. The transfer was in fact prevented by an attack of
apoplexy from which Penn suffered in 1712. The epistle, however, brought
the refractory assembly to terms. After exacting a concession of their right
to sit on their own adjournment, they consented to the establishment of a
judiciary, without, however, a court of appeal, and finally yielded to passing
votes to defray the expenses of government. They even gave £2,000
to the crown in aid of the war. Affairs went smoothly under Gookin’s
administration until, in 1714, the governor, whose mind is supposed to
have been impaired, began the quarrel again by complaining about his
scanty salary and the irregularity of payments. He also insisted foolishly
upon the illegality of affirmation; foolishly, because the Quakers, who would
not allow any other kind of oath, were the dominant party in the province.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
Not satisfied with the commotion he had stirred up, he suddenly turned
upon his friend Logan, and had now not only the anti-Penn faction, but
also Penn’s adherents, to contend with. The last ill-advised step resulted
in his recall (1717) and the appointment of Sir William Keith, the last
governor commissioned by Penn himself; for the great founder of Pennsylvania
died in 1718.</p>

<p>While after Penn’s death his heirs went to law among themselves about
the government and proprietary rights in Pennsylvania, Governor Keith,
who as surveyor of customs in the southern provinces had become sufficiently
familiar with Penn’s affairs, entered on the performance of his
duties under the most favorable conditions. The assembly had become
weary to disgust with the continuous disputes and altercations forced upon
them by the last two governors, and it was therefore easily influenced by
Sir William’s good address and evident effort to please. Without hesitation
it voted a salary of £500 for the governor, and acted upon his
suggestion to examine the state of the laws, some of which were obsolete
or had expired by their own limitations. The province was somewhat
disturbed by the lawsuit of the family for the succession, finally
settled in favor of Penn’s children by his second wife, and by a war of the
southern Indians with the Susquehanna and New York tribes; but nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
marred the relations between governor and legislature. Under the
speakership of James Trent, later chief justice of New Jersey (where the
city of Trenton was named after him),<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> an act for the advancement of justice
and more certain administration thereof, a measure of great importance to
the province, passed the previous year (1718), became a law by receiving the
royal assent. Governor Keith’s proposal in 1720 to establish a Court of
Chancery met with unqualified approval by the assembly. Under the next
governor this court “came to be considered as so great a nuisance” that
after a while it fell into disuse.</p>

<p>In 1721 the first great council which the Five Nations ever held with
the white people outside of the province of New York and at any other
place than Albany, N. Y., took place at Conestoga, and the disputes which
had threatened the outlying settlements with the horrors of Indian war
were amicably settled. The treaty of friendship made here was confirmed
the next year at a council held at Albany, as in the mean time the wanton
murder of an Iroquois by some Pennsylvania traders had somewhat strained
the mutual relations.</p>

<p>The commercial and agricultural interests of the province began to suffer
about this time for want of a sufficient quantity of a circulating medium.
Divers means of relief were proposed, among them the issue of bills of
credit. Governor Keith and the majority of the traders, merchants, and
farmers were enchanted with the notion of fiat money, and overlooked or
were unwilling to profit by the experiences of other provinces which had already
suffered from the mischievous consequences of such a measure. The
result was that, after considerable discussion, turning not so much upon the
bills of credit themselves as upon the mode of issuing them and the method
of guarding against their depreciation, the emission of £15,000 was authorized,
despite the order of the king in council of May 19, 1720, which forbade
all the governors of the colonies in America to pass any laws sanctioning
the issue of bills of credit. It would lead us too far beyond the
limits of this chapter to inquire whether, as Dr. Douglass, of Boston,
suggested in 1749, the assembly ordering this emission of £15,000 bills
of credit, and another of £30,000 in the same year, was “a legislature
of debtors, the representatives of people who, from incogitancy, idleness,
and profuseness, have been under a necessity of mortgaging their lands.”
All the safeguards thrown around such a currency to prevent its depreciation
proved in the end futile. The acts creating this debt of £45,000<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> provided
for its redemption a pledge of real estate in fee simple of double the value,
recorded in an office created for that purpose. The money so lent out was
to be repaid into the office annually, in such instalments as would make it
possible to sink the whole original issue within a certain number of years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
In the first three years the sinking and destruction of the redeemed bills
went on as directed by law; but under its operation the community found
itself suffering from the contraction, although only about one seventh of
the debt had been paid. The legislature, therefore, passed a law (1726)
directing that the bills should not be destroyed, as the former acts required,
but that, during the following eight years, they should be reissued.
The population of the province, growing by natural increase and by immigration,
seeming to require a larger volume of currency, a new emission
of £30,000 was ordered in 1729 under the provisions of the laws of 1723.
In 1731 the law of 1726 was reënacted, to prevent disasters which threatened
the farmer as well as the merchant, and to avoid making new acts
for emitting more bills. In 1739 the amount of bills in circulation, £68,890,
was increased to £80,000, equal to £50,000 sterling, because the legislature
had discovered that the former sum fell “short of a proper medium
for negotiating the commerce and for the support of the government.”
They justified this step, and tried to explain why a pound of Pennsylvania
currency was of so much less value than a pound sterling by asserting that
the difference arose only from the balance of Pennsylvania’s trade with
Great Britain, which was in favor of the former, since more English
goods found their way here now that bills of credit had become the fashion.
The act of 1739 had made the bills then in circulation irredeemable for a
short term of years, which in 1745 was extended to sixteen years more
under the following modifications: the first ten years, up to 1755, no bill
was to be redeemed, or, if redeemed, was to be reissued; after 1755 one
sixth of the whole amount was to be paid in yearly and the bills were to be
destroyed. In 1746 a further issue of £5,000 for the king’s use was ordered,
to be sunk in ten yearly instalments of £500 each, and in 1749 Pennsylvania
currency, valued in 1723 at thirteen shillings sterling per pound, had, like
all other colonial money, so far depreciated that a pound was equal to eleven
shillings and one and one third pence.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>When the limit of the year 1755 was reached many of the bills of credit
had become so torn and defaced that the assembly ordered £10,000 in new
bills to be exchanged for the old ones. In the mean time the French war
had begun, and to support the troops sent over from England £60,000
were issued in bills to be given to the king’s use.</p>

<p>By this time Pennsylvania had become so largely in debt as to make her
taxes burdensome. Notwithstanding a hesitation to increase the volume of
indebtedness, her assembly felt called upon by reason of the war to contribute
her share of the cost of it, and in September, 1756, a further issue
of £30,000 was authorized under a law which provided for the redemption
of the bills in ten years by an excise on wine, liquor, etc. If this excise
should bring in more than was necessary, the “overplus” was to go into
the hands of the king.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Governor Keith took care to increase his popularity with the assembly,
and thereby to advance his own personal interest in a greater degree than
was compatible with his allegiance to the proprietary’s family. Having
managed to free himself from the control of the council, who were men
respecting their oaths and friends of the Penn family, he incurred the displeasure
of the widow of the great Quaker, and in 1726 was superseded
by Patrick Gordon. Keith and his friend David Lloyd had vainly endeavored
to persuade Hannah Penn that her views concerning the council’s
participation in legislative matters were erroneous, and that the
council was in fact created for ornamental purposes and to be spectators
of the governor’s actions. This opinion of Keith was of course in opposition
to the instructions which he had received. Fully to understand
the condition of affairs, we must remember that the government of this
colony was as much the private property of the proprietary as the soil;
and that in giving instructions to his deputy and establishing a council to
assist the deputy by their advice, the proprietary did no more than a careful
business man would do when compelled to absent himself from his
place of business,&mdash;or at least such were the views of the Penns.</p>

<p>The even tenor of political life in Pennsylvania, the greater part of whose
inhabitants were either Quakers, religiously opposed to any kind of strife,
or Germans, totally ignorant of the modes of constitutional government,
was somewhat disturbed during the first two or three years of Gordon’s
administration by Keith’s intrigue as a member of the assembly, to which
he was soon chosen. We are told that he endeavored by “all means in
his power to divide the inhabitants, embarrass the administration, and distress
the proprietary family.” He grew, however, as unpopular as he had
been popular; and when he finally returned to England, where he died
about 1749, the colony again enjoyed quiet for several years.</p>

<p>Governor Gordon had in his earlier life been bred to arms, and he had
served in the army with considerable repute until the end of Queen Anne’s
reign. As a soldier he had learned the value of moderation; and not forgetting
it in civil life, his administration was distinguished by prudence
and a regard for the interests of the province, while his peaceful Indian
policy secured for the colony a period of almost unprecedented prosperity.
Planted in 1682, nearly fifty years later than her neighbors, Pennsylvania
could boast in 1735 that her chief city, Philadelphia, was the second in size
in the colonies, and her white population larger than that of Virginia, Maryland,
and the Carolinas.</p>

<p>The death of Hannah Penn, the widow of the first proprietor, in 1733,
threatened to put a sudden stop to Gordon’s rule, since the assembly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
deeming his authority to be derived from Hannah Penn, and to end with
her death, refused him obedience. The arrival of a new commission, executed
by John, Thomas, and Richard Penn, quickly settled this question,
as well as another point. The king’s approval of it reserved specially to
the crown the government of the Lower Counties, if it chose to claim it.
Of the progress in Gordon’s time towards the settlement of the disputed
boundary with Maryland, the recital is given in another chapter.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Upon Gordon’s death, in 1736, James Logan, the lifelong friend of Penn,
succeeded as president of the council, but gave place, after two uneventful
years, to the new governor, George Thomas, who had been formerly a
planter in the island of Antigua.</p>

<p>A promise of continued quiet was harshly disturbed when the governor
authorized the enrolment of bought or indented servants in the militia.
Opposed to the use of military arms under all conditions, the Quakers
who owned these enrolled servants, of whom 276 had been taken, were
still more aggrieved by having their own property appropriated to such
uses. The assembly finally voted the sum of £2,588 to compensate the
owners for the loss of their chattels, but the feeling engendered by the governor’s
action was not soothed. The relations between governor and assembly
became strained; the governor refusing to give his assent to acts
passed by the assembly, and the latter neglecting to vote a salary for the
governor. This condition of affairs may have led to the serious election
riots which disturbed Philadelphia in 1742. The governor, who had only
received £500 of his salary, began to be embarrassed, and was in the end
induced by his straits to assent to bills beyond the pale of his instructions,
while the assembly soothed him by no longer withholding his salary. In
this way good feeling and quiet were restored, and when, in 1747, he decided
to resign, the regret of the assembly was unfeigned.</p>

<p>After a short interregnum, during which Anthony Palmer, as president
of the council, ruled the province, James Hamilton was appointed deputy-governor
by the proprietors, Richard and Thomas Penn. He entered upon
his duties with good omens. He was born in the country, and his father
had somewhat earlier enjoyed an eminence from the result of the Zenger
trial such as no lawyer in America had enjoyed before. For a while the
assembly and Hamilton were mutually pleased; but as, in time, he withheld
his assent to bills that infringed the proprietary’s right to the interest
of loans, the assembly was arrayed against him, and rendered his position
so unpleasant that in 1753 he sent to England his resignation, to
take effect in a year. His place was taken by Robert Hunter Morris, son
of the chief justice of New Jersey, who was, like Hamilton, a man thoroughly
conscientious and conversant with the political life in the colonies.
Very early in his term he came in conflict with the assembly on a money
bill, which his instructions would not allow him to sign. Hampered by
these orders, he was unable to rely upon his judgment or feelings and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
act independently; hence very soon, in 1756, he resigned, and retired to
New Jersey, where he died in 1764.</p>

<p>The state of affairs under the next governor, William Denny, is shown
by a passage in one of his early messages. “Though moderation is most
agreeable to me,” he says to the assembly, “there might have been a governor
who would have told you, the whole tenor of your message was indecent,
frivolous, and evasive.” Again the instructions were the cause of all
trouble. The governor was in duty bound to withhold his assent from
every act for the emission of bills of credit that did not subject the money
to the joint disposal of the governor and assembly, and from every act increasing
the amount of bills of credit or confirming existing issues, unless a
provision directed that the rents of proprietary lands were to be paid in sterling
money, while the taxes on these lands could not become a lien on the
same. The treasury of the province was on the verge of complete bankruptcy,
when the governor rejected a bill levying £100,000 on all real and
personal property, including the proprietary lands. Seeing no other way
out of the dilemma, the assembly amended their bill by exempting the proprietary
interests from taxation, but they sought their revenge by sending
an agent, Benjamin Franklin, to England to represent their grievances to
the crown. Franklin reached London in July, 1757, and entered immediately
upon a quarrel with the proprietors respecting their rights, from
which he issued as victor. Denny, tired of the struggle, and in need of
money, finally disobeyed his instructions, gave his assent to obnoxious bills,
and was recalled, to give way to Hamilton, who in 1759 was again installed.</p>

<p>Hamilton went through his second term without strife. There were too
many external dangers to engage the assembly’s attention. Parliament, in
anticipation of a Spanish war, had appropriated £200,000 for fortifying the
colony posts; the assembly took the province’s share of it, £26,000, and
made ready to receive the Spanish privateers, to whose attacks by the Delaware
the country lay invitingly open. The danger was not so great as it
seemed. In 1763 Hamilton was superseded by John Penn, the son of Richard
and grandson of William Penn.</p>

<p class="p2">During these later years, Pennsylvania could justly be called the most
flourishing of the English colonies. A fleet of four hundred sail left Philadelphia
yearly with the season’s produce. The colony’s free population numbered
220,000 souls, and of these possibly half were German folk, who had
known not a little of Old World oppression; one sixth were Quakers, more
than a sixth were Presbyterians, another sixth were Episcopalians, and there
were a few Baptists. The spirit and tenets of the first framers of its government,
as the Quakers had been, were calculated to attract the attention
of oppressed sectaries everywhere, and bodies of many diversified beliefs,
from different parts of Europe, flocked to the land, took up their abodes,
and are recognized in their descendants to-day. Conspicuous among these
immigrants were those of the sect called Unitas Fratrum, United Brethren,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
or Moravians, who settled principally in the present county of Northampton.
Though they labored successfully among the Indians in making converts,
it was rare that they succeeded in uniting to their communion any of
their Christian neighbors. The Moravians had been preceded by a sect
of similar tenets, the adherents of Schwenckfeld. They had come to Pennsylvania
in 1732 and mostly settled in the present county of Montgomery.
Still earlier a sort of German Baptists, called Dunkers, Tunkers, or Dumplers,
coming to America between 1719 and 1729, had found homes in
Lancaster County. Another sect of Baptists, the followers of Menno Simon,
or Mennonists,&mdash;like the Friends, opposed to taking oaths and bearing
arms,&mdash;had begun to make their way across the ocean as early as
1698, induced thereto by information derived from Penn himself. Like the
Dunkers, they chose Lancaster County for their American homes.</p>

<p>But there were other motives than religious ones. There came many
Welsh, Irish, and Scotch farmers. The Welsh were a valuable stock; the
same cannot be said of the Irish, who began to come in 1719, and continued
to arrive in such large numbers that special legislation in regard to them
was required in 1729. An act laying a duty on foreigners and Irish servants
imported into the province was passed May 10, 1729. This act was
repealed, but many features of it were embodied in an act of the following
year, imposing a duty on persons convicted of heinous crimes, and preventing
poor and impotent persons being imported into the province. It must
be acknowledged that the Catholic religion, professed by these immigrants,
had not a little to do with the temper of the legislation which restrained
them, in a colony which had been modelled on the principles of religious
freedom. It was not assuring, on the other hand, for the legislators to discover
that the sympathy which the Roman priests showed for the French
enemies of the province foreboded mischief.</p>

<p class="p2">It has been told in a previous chapter how New Jersey passed from the
state of a conquered province to that of a proprietary or settled colony, and
how little the change of dynasty in England affected the public affairs of
this section of the middle colonies. The proprietors of East New Jersey
had grown weary of governing the province, and in April, 1688, had drawn
up an act surrendering their share. The revolutionary disturbances in
England which soon followed prevented action upon this surrender; but
when, at the beginning of the next century, the proprietors of West New
Jersey also showed themselves willing to surrender the burden and cares of
government to the crown, the Lords of Trade gave it as their opinion that
no sufficient form of government had ever been formed in New Jersey,
that many inconveniences and disorders had been the result of the proprietors’
pretence of right to govern, and advised the Law Lords to accept the
surrender. The proprietors reserved to themselves all their rights in the
soil of the province, while they abandoned the privilege of governing.
East and West New Jersey, now become again one province, was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ruled by a governor, a council of twelve members appointed by the crown,
and twenty-four assembly-men elected by the freeholders. The governor
was given the right of adjourning and dissolving the assembly at pleasure,
and of vetoing any act passed by council and assembly, his assent being
subject to the approval or dissent of the king.</p>

<p>When surrendering in 1701 their rights of government, the proprietors
recommended, for the office of royal governor, Andrew Hamilton, their
representative in the colony, in whose ability and integrity they had the
fullest confidence, and who during his previous terms as governor had also
won the admiration and reverence of the governed. Intrigues against
Hamilton, instituted by two influential proprietors, Dockwra and Sonmans,
and by Colonel Quary, of Pennsylvania, resulted in Hamilton’s defeat and
the appointment of Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, who was already governor
of New York. Cornbury published his commission in New Jersey
on the 11th of August, 1703, and inaugurated, by his way of dealing with
the affairs of the colony, the same series of violent contests between the
governor and the people, represented by the assembly, that had served
under him to keep New York unsettled. Complaints made by the proprietors
against him in England had no effect, although he had clearly violated
his instructions, by unseating three members of the assembly; by making
money the proper qualification for election to the same, instead of land;
and by allowing an act taxing unprofitable and waste land to become a law.
His successor, John, Lord Lovelace, appointed early in 1708, arrived in
New York early in December of the same year. He had various schemes
for the improvement of both colonies, but it is doubtful whether his previous
position of cornet in the royal horse-guards had fitted him for administrative
and executive work. A disease was, moreover, already fastened
upon him, which in a few months carried him off. His successor,
Major Richard Ingoldsby, is best described by Bellomont, under whom he
had previously served in New York. “Major Ingoldesby has been absent
from his post four years,” says Bellomont in a letter to the Lords of Trade,
October 17, 1700, “and is so brutish as to leave his wife and children here
to starve. Ingoldesby is of a worthy family, but is a rash, hot-headed man,
and had a great hand in the execution of Leisler and Milburn, for which
reason, if there were no other, he is not fit to serve in this country, having
made himself hatefull to the Leisler party.” Cornbury understood the
man so fully that he would not allow him to act as lieutenant-governor of
either New York or New Jersey, to which office he had been appointed in
1704. Ingoldsby’s commission as lieutenant-governor was revoked in
1706, but he was admitted as a member of the council for New Jersey. It
seems that the order revoking the commission was not sent out to New
York in 1706, for upon Lord Lovelace’s death he assumed the government,
and acted so brutally that, when news of it reached England, a new order
of revocation was issued. In the short interval before the arrival of his
successor, Governor Robert Hunter, who published his commission in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Jersey in the summer of 1710, Ingoldsby had managed to get into conflict
with the assembly, largely formed of members from the Society of Friends,
and brought about the state of affairs which we may call usual in all the
British colonies ruled by a governor appointed by the king, and by an
assembly elected by the people. Hunter must be termed the first satisfactory
governor of New Jersey. Early in his administration he met with opposition
from those who so far had slavishly followed the royal governor.
These opponents were the council of the province, who objected to every
measure which Governor Hunter, advised by Lewis Morris and other influential
members of the Quaker or country party, deemed necessary for the
public good. The council was entirely under the thumb of Secretary Jeremiah
Basse, who, having been an Anabaptist minister, agent in England
for the West Jersey Society, governor of East and West Jersey, had shared
in the obloquy attached to Lord Cornbury’s administration. Public business
threatened to come to a standstill, as the home authorities were slow
in acting on recommendations to remove the obnoxious members of the
council. Hunter constantly prorogued the assembly of New Jersey; “it
being absolutely needless to meet the assembly so long as the council is so
constituted,” he writes to the Lords of Trade, June 23, 1712, “for they have
avowedly opposed the government in most things, and by their influence
obstructed the payment of a great part of the taxes.” But it was not until
August, 1713, that the queen approved of the removal of William Pinhorn,
Daniel Coxe, Peter Sonmans, and William Hall from the council, in whose
places John Anderson, a wealthy trader and farmer of Perth Amboy, John
Hamilton, postmaster-general of North America, and John Reading, of
West Jersey, were appointed. William Morris, recommended in place of
Sonmans, had died meanwhile. Sonmans stole and took out of the province
all public records, and, having gone to England with his booty, he used
the papers to injure Governor Hunter in the estimation of the people of
New Jersey, while “our men of noise” agitated against him in the province
and in its assembly. No effort was spared to prevent a renewal of Hunter’s
commission in 1714, and when he was reappointed notwithstanding,
Coxe, Sonmans, and their friends had so inflamed the “lower rank of people
that only time and patience, or stronger measures, could allay the heat.”
At last it became an absolute necessity to summon the assembly again, and
an act “for fixing the sessions of assembly in the Jersies at Burlington”
was passed in 1715, which became the cause of incessant attacks upon the
governor by Coxe and his party. Hunter, seeing the wheels of government
stopped by the factious absence of Coxe and his friends from the legislative
sessions, said to the assembly, May 19, 1716: “Whereas, it is apparent and
evident that there is at present a combination amongst some of your members
to disappoint and defeat your meetings as a house of representatives
by their wilful absenting themselves from the service of their country ...
I have judged it absolutely necessary ... to require you forthwith to meet
as a house of representatives, and to take the usual methods to oblige your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
fellow members to pay their attendance.” The assembly, like a sensible
body, aware that Governor Hunter had always acted with justice and moderation,
answered his appeal to them by expelling on the 23d of May their
speaker, Coxe, as a man whose study it had been to disturb the quiet and
tranquillity of the province, and such other members as did not attend and
could not be found by the sergeant-at-arms of the house.</p>

<p>Coxe did not consider himself vanquished. An appeal to the king followed.
Coxe charged Hunter with illegal acts of every kind, and his petition
was numerously signed; but the council certified that his subscribers
were “for the most part the lowest and meanest of the people,” and the
king sustained and commended the governor. When, a few years later,
Hunter resolved to return to Europe to recover his health at the baths of
Aix-la-Chapelle, he could with pride assert that the provinces governed by
him “were in perfect peace, to which both had long been strangers.”</p>

<p>William Burnet, who succeeded his friend Hunter, was not so amiable
a man, and showed the airs of personal importance too much to suit the
Quaker spirit which prevailed among the New Jersey people. He needed
money to live upon, however, and there was something of the Jacobite
opposition in the province for him to suppress. He had difficulty at first in
getting the assembly to pass other than temporary bills; but in 1722 the
governor and assembly had reached an understanding, and Burnet passed
through the rest of his term without much conflict with the legislature,
and when transferred to the chair of Massachusetts, in 1728, he turned
over the government in a quiet condition, and with few or no wounds unhealed.</p>

<p>The most notable event during the three years’ term of his successor,
Montgomerie, was the renewal of an effort, already attempted in Burnet’s
time, but defeated by him, to have New Jersey made again a government
separate from New York. “By order of the house 4th 5mo, 1730,” John
Kinsey, Junr., speaker, signed a petition to the king for a separate governor.
Montgomerie died July 1, 1731, and Lewis Morris, as president of
the council, governed till September, 1732, when Cosby, the new governor,
arrived. The grand jury of Middlesex tried to further the attempt for a
separate government in 1736, but nothing was done till Cosby died, when
Morris, whom Cosby had shamefully maligned, received the appointment
from a grateful king, and New Jersey was again possessed of a separate
governor.</p>

<p>Governor Morris published his commission at Amboy on the 29th of
August, 1738; at Burlington a few days later. The council, with the assembly,
expressed the thanks and joy of the people in unmeasured terms,
prophetically seeing trade and commerce flourish and justice more duly
and speedily administered under the new rule. The pleasant relations
between the governor and the representatives of the people which these
expressions of satisfaction seemed to foreshadow were not to be of long
duration. “There is so much insincerity and ignorance among the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
... and so strong an inclination in the meanest of the people to have the
sole direction of all the affairs of the government,” writes Morris to his
friend Sir Charles Wager, one of the treasury lords, May 10, 1739, “that
it requires much more temper, skill, and constancy to overcome these
difficulties than fall to every man’s share.” Under these influences, Morris,
the former leader of the popular party, betrayed them, and tried to
obey his instructions to the very letter. Following the example set by
Cosby, of New York, in regard to the salary of an absent governor and
a present lieutenant-governor or president of the council, he began to quarrel
with John Hamilton, who as president had temporarily acted as governor.
Fortunately for Morris’s reputation, this case did not grow into such
a public scandal as the Cosby-Van Dam case, mentioned above, and was
quietly settled in the proper way. The assembly, having early discovered
that Morris was not an easy man to deal with, tried to discipline him by
interfering with the disposal of the revenue granted for the support of the
government, and finally refused to pass supply bills unless the governor disobeyed
his instructions and assented to bills enacted by them. The wheels
of the governmental machinery threatened to come to a standstill for
want of money, when Morris, after an illness of some weeks, died at Trenton
on the 21st of May, 1746, leaving the government of the province to
his whilom adversary. John Hamilton, as president of the council, who
was then already suffering from ill health, prorogued the assembly, then
sitting at Trenton, and reconvened them at Perth Amboy, his own home.
Relieved of their political enemy, Morris, the assembly became more amenable
to reason, and during Hamilton’s brief administration “chearfully
made provision for raising 500 men” for the Canada expedition, and lent
the government £10,000 to arm and equip the New Jersey contingent.
Hamilton soon succumbed to his disease, and died June 17, 1747. When
John Reading, another member of the council, succeeded to power, his
administration of a few months was mainly signalized by riots at Perth
Amboy,&mdash;in which Reading was roughly handled. These disturbances
were caused by an act to vacate and annul grants of land and to divest
owners of property which had been bought some years before from the
Indians.</p>

<p>Jonathan Belcher, after being removed in 1741<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> from the executive
office of Massachusetts, had gone to England, where, with the assistance
of his brother-in-law, Richard Partridge, the agent at court for New Jersey,
he obtained the appointment of governor of this province. When he first
met the council and assembly of New Jersey, on the 20th of August, 1747,
he said to them, “I shall strictly conform myself to the king’s commands
and to the powers granted me therein, as also to the additional authorities
contained in the king’s royal orders to me, and from these things I think
you will not desire me to deviate.” Belcher had not yet had occasion to
arouse the anger of the assembly, when the latter, at their first session,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of unusual long duration (fourteen weeks), already showed their distrust of
him by voting his salary for one year only, and not “a penny more” than
to the late governor, who had “harast and plagued them sufficiently.”
Belcher was too well inured to colonial politics openly to manifest his
anger at such treatment, or to tell the assembly that he considered them
“very stingy,” as he called them in a letter to Partridge. His administration
gave evidence of his ability to yield gracefully up to the limits of his
instructions; but when a conflict with his assembly could not be avoided,
he faced it stubbornly. On the whole, his rule resulted in a much-needed
quiet for the province, which was only briefly disturbed by the riots already
mentioned, which had begun before Belcher’s arrival. The members of the
assembly, who depended largely for their election on the votes of these
rioters, sympathized with the lawless element in Essex and other counties;
but in the end wiser counsels prevailed, and the disturbances ceased.</p>

<p>In another part of the province the dispute over the boundary line with
New York, as it affected titles of land, was also a source of agitation, which
in Belcher’s time was the cause of constant remonstrance and appeal and
of legislative intervention, but he left the question unsettled, a legacy of
disturbance for later composition.</p>

<p>Age and a paralytic disorder, which even the electrical apparatus that
Franklin sent to Belcher could not remove, ended Belcher’s life on the
31st of August, 1757, leaving the government in the hands of Thomas
Pownall, who, on account of Belcher’s age and infirmity, had been appointed
lieutenant-governor in 1755. Pownall was at the time of Belcher’s
death also governor of Massachusetts. After a short visit to New Jersey
he found “that the necessity of his majesty’s service in the government
of the Massachusetts Bay” required his return to Boston, and his absence
brought the active duties of the executive once more upon Reading, as
senior counsellor, who, through age and illness, was little disposed towards
the burden.</p>

<p>The arrival, on the 15th of June, 1758, of Francis Bernard, bearing a
commission as governor, relieved Reading of his irksome duties. Bernard
had, during his short term, the satisfaction of pacifying the Indians by a
treaty made at Easton in October, 1758. The otherwise uneventful term
of his administration was soon ended by his transfer to Massachusetts.
His successor, Thomas Boone, after an equally short and uneventful term,
was replaced by Josiah Hardy, and the latter by William Franklin, the son
of the great philosopher. The latter had secured his appointment through
Lord Bute, but nothing can be said in this chapter of his administration,
which, beginning in 1762, belongs to another volume.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The possible injury which a development of the manufacturing interests
in the colonies might inflict on like interests in Great Britain agitated the
mind of the English manufacturer at an early date. Already in Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
times this question of manufactures in the province of New Netherland had
been settled rather peremptorily by an order of the Assembly of the Nineteen,
which made it a felony to engage in the making of any woollen,
linen, or cotton cloth. The English Parliament, perhaps influenced by the
manufacturers among their constituents, or not willing to appear as legislating
in the interest of money, declared, in 1719, “that the erecting of manufactories
in the colonies tends to lessen their dependence on Great Britain,”
and a prohibition similar to that of the Dutch authorities was enacted.
During the whole colonial period this feeling of jealousy interfered with
the development of industries and delayed their growth. Whatever England
could not produce was expected to be made here, such as naval stores,
pearlash and potash, and silks; but the English manufacturer strenuously
set himself in opposition to any colonial enterprise which affected his own
profits.</p>

<p>Shipbuilding and the saw-mill had early sprung from the domestic necessities
of the people. The Dutch had made the windmill a striking feature
in the landscape of New York. The people of Pennsylvania had been the
earliest in the middle colonies to establish a press, and it had brought the
paper-mill in its train, though after a long interval; for it was not till
1697 that the manufacture of paper began near Philadelphia, and not
till thirty years later (1728) was the second mill established at Elizabethtown
in New Jersey. The Dutch had begun the making of glass in New
York city, near what is now Hanover Square, and in Philadelphia it was
becoming an industry as early as 1683; though if one may judge from the
use of oiled paper in the first houses of Germantown, the manufacture of
window-glass began later. Wistar, a palatine, erected a glass-house near
Salem, in West New Jersey, in 1740, and Governor Moore, of New York,
in 1767, says of a bankrupt glass-maker in New York that his ill success
had come of his imported workmen deserting him after he had brought
them over from Europe at great cost.</p>

<p>The presence of iron ore in the hills along the Hudson had been known
to the Dutch, but they had made no attempt to work the mines, relying
probably to some extent upon Massachusetts, where “a good store of iron”
was manufactured from an early date. Towards the end of the seventeenth
century, when the ore was tried, the founders discovered the iron to be too
brittle to encourage its use. Lieutenant-Governor Clarke tried to arouse
interest for the iron industry in 1737, and induced the general assembly to
consider the advisability of encouraging proprietors of iron-works; but the
movement came to nothing, and Parliament did what it could to thwart all
such purposes by enacting a law “to encourage the importation of pig and
bar iron from his Majesty’s Colonies in America, and to prevent the erection
of any Mill or other Engine for Slitting or Rolling of Iron; or any
plating Forge to work with a Tilt Hammer; or any Furnace for making
Steel in any of the said Colonies.” When this act was passed in 1750 only
a single plating-forge existed in the province of New York, at Wawayanda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Orange County, which had been built about 1745, and was not in use at
the time. Two furnaces and several blomaries had been established
about the same time in the manor of Cortland, Westchester County, but
a few years had sufficed to bring their business to a disastrous end.</p>

<p>In 1757 the province could show only one iron-work at Ancram, which
produced nothing but pig and bar iron. At this same establishment,
owned by the Livingstons, in the present Columbia County, many a cannon
was cast some years later to help in the defence of American liberties.
In 1766 we find a little foundry established in New York for making small
iron pots, but its operations had not yet become very extensive.</p>

<p>The first iron-works in New Jersey seem to have been opened by an
Englishman, James Grover, who had become dissatisfied with the rule of
the Dutch and the West India Company, and had removed from Long
Island to Shrewsbury, New Jersey, where he and some iron-workers from
Massachusetts set up one of the first forges in the province.</p>

<p>In 1676 the Morris family, which later became so prominent in colonial
politics, was granted a large tract of land near the Raritan River, with the
right “to dig, delve, and carry away all such mines for iron as they shall
find” in that tract. The smelting-furnace and forge mentioned in an account
of the province by the proprietors of East New Jersey, in 1682, employing
both whites and blacks, was probably on the Morris estate. The
mineral treasures of the province, however, remained on the whole undiscovered
at the end of the century; but in the following century several
blomary forges and one charcoal-furnace were erected in Warren County,
the latter of which was still running twenty-five years ago. Penn had early
learned of the richness of his province in iron and copper, though no attempt
was made to mine them till 1698. At this early period Gabriel
Thomas mentions the discovery of mineral ores, which were probably
found in the Chester County of that day, and the first iron-works in the
province were built in that region. Governor Keith owned iron-works in
New Castle County (Delaware) between 1720 and 1730, and had such good
opinion of the iron industry in the colonies that he considered them capable
of supplying, if sufficiently encouraged, the mother country with all the
pig and bar iron needed.</p>

<p>In 1718 we read of iron-works forty miles up the Schuylkill River, probably
the Coventry forge, on French Creek, in Chester County; also of a
forge in Berks or Montgomery County, which in 1728 became the scene of
an Indian attack. The mineral wealth of Lancaster County soon attracted
the attention of the thrifty Germans who had settled there. In 1728 this
county had two or more furnaces in blast, and the number of them in the
province increased rapidly up to the time of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Upon the Delaware, the Dutch and Swedes seem to have neglected the
ores of silver, copper, iron, and other minerals, which they did not fail to
discover existed in that region; but an Englishman, Charles Pickering,
who lived in Charlestown, Chester County, Pennsylvania, appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
been the earliest to mine copper, and was on trial in 1683 on the charge of
uttering base coin. A letter written by Governor Morris, of New Jersey,
to Thomas Penn in 1755, speaks of a copper-mine at the Gap in Lancaster
County, which had been discovered twenty years previous by a German
miner.</p>

<p>It was New Jersey, however, which led in the working of copper ore.
Arent Schuyler, belonging to a Dutch family of Albany, New York, prominent
in politics and in other matters, had removed in 1710 to a farm purchased
at New Barbadoes Neck, on the Passaic River, near Newark.
There one of his negroes re-discovered a copper-mine, known to the Dutch
and probably worked before by them, asking as a reward for it all the tobacco
he could smoke, and the permission “to live with massa till I die.”
The ore taken from this mine proved to be so very rich in metal, copper
and silver, that Parliament placed it on the list of enumerated articles, in
order to secure it for the British market. Arent Schuyler’s son John introduced
into the middle colonies the first steam-engine, requiring it to keep
his copper-mine free from water. The copper-mining industry found another
adherent about 1750 in Elias Boudinot, who opened a pit near New
Brunswick, and erected there a stamping-mill, the products of which were
sent to England and highly valued there. When Governor Hunter, in a
letter to the Lords of Trade, November 12, 1715, speaks of “a copper mine
here brought to perfection,” he undoubtedly refers to a New Jersey or Pennsylvania
undertaking, for five years later he answers the question, “What
mines are in the province of New York?” with, “Iron enough, copper but
rare, lead at a great distance in the Indian settlement, coal mines on Long
Island, but not yet wrought.” The coal mines, which have added so much
to the wealth of Pennsylvania during the present century, had not been
discovered during the period preceding the Revolution.</p>

<p>It has been said above that the colonies were expected to engage in the
production of potash and pearlash. This was an industry already recommended
as profitable by the secretary of New Netherland in 1650. The
dearness of labor, however, interfered with its development, for “the woods
were infinite,” and supplied all the necessary material. The attempt, about
1700, to employ Indians at this work failed, for “the Indians are so proud
and lazy.” About 1710 a potash factory was established in the province of
New York at the expense of an English capitalist, who found it, however,
a losing investment. Not discouraged by previous failures, John Keble, of
New Jersey, proposed to set up a manufacture of potash. He petitioned
for authority to do so, and from his statements we learn that in 1704 Pennsylvania
alone of the middle colonies exported potash, and only to the
amount of 630 pounds a year. There is no information as to Keble’s success,
but a memorial of London merchants to the Lords of Trade in 1729,
asking that the manufacture of this important staple in the colonies might
be encouraged, drew forth the opinion that not enough was thought of this
industry to “draw the people from employing that part of their time (winter)
in working up both Wooling and Linen Cloth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition points to many a house, in the region originally settled by the
Dutch, as having been built with bricks imported from Holland. That
such was not the rule, but only an exception, in the days of the West India
Company’s rule, is proved by the frequent allusion to brick-kilns on the
Hudson, near Albany and Esopus, and on the Lower Delaware. For the
convenience of transportation, the trade has centred in these localities to
this day.</p>

<p>The making of salt, either by the solar process or by other means, was
a necessity which appealed to the colonists at an early period. The Onondaga
salt-springs had been discovered by a Jesuit about 1654, but, being
then in the heart of the Indian country, they could not be worked by the
French or Dutch. Coney Island had been selected in 1661 as a proper
place for salt-works, but the political dissensions of the day did not allow
operations to go on there. The Navigation Act of 1663, prohibiting the
importation into the colonies of any manufactures of Europe except through
British ports, made an exception in favor of salt. The result was that this
industry was carried on in the middle colonies during the colonial period
only in a few small establishments, furnishing not enough for local consumption.</p>

<p>When the palatines began to emigrate, and there was fear that they
would carry with them the art of making woollens, Parliament in 1709 forbade
such manufactures in the colonies. In 1715 the towns-people of New
York and Albany, probably also of Perth Amboy, Burlington, and Philadelphia,
are reported as wearing English cloth, while the poor planters are
satisfied with a coarse textile of their own make. Nearly two thirds of
such fabrics used in the colonies were made there, and the Lords of Trade
were afraid that, if such manufacture was not stopped, “it will be of great
prejudice to the trade of this kingdom.” Governor Hunter very sensibly
opposed any legislation which would force the people to wear English cloth,
as it would be equivalent to compelling them to go naked. A report of the
Board of Trade, made in 1732, tells us that “they had no manufactures in
the province of New York that deserve mentioning;... no manufactures
in New Jersey that deserve mentioning.” “The deputy-governor of Pennsylvania
does not know of any trade in that province that can be considered
injurious to this kingdom. They do not export any woollen or linen
manufactures; all that they make, which are of a coarse sort, being for
their own use.”</p>

<p>The statements embodied in reports of this kind were made upon information
acquired with difficulty, for the crown officers in the colonies interrogated
an unwilling people, who saw no virtue in affording the grounds of
their own business repression, and concealed or disguised the truth without
much compunction of conscience; and in Massachusetts the legislative
assembly had gone so far as to call to account a crown officer who had
divulged to the House of Commons the facts respecting the exportation of
beaver hats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>An address of the British House of Commons to the king, presented on
the 27th of March, 1766, called forth a description of the textile manufactures
in the province of New York at the close of the period of which this
chapter treats. The Society of Arts and Agriculture of New York City
had about this date established a small manufactory of linen, with fourteen
looms, to give employment to several poor families, hitherto a charge upon
the community. No broadcloth was then made in the province, and some
poor weavers from Yorkshire, who had come over in the expectation of
finding remunerative work, had been sadly disappointed. But coarse woollen
goods were extensively made. One of these native textile fabrics, called
linsey-woolsey, and made of linen warp and woollen woof, became a political
sign during the Stamp Act excitement. People “desirous of distinguishing
themselves as American patriots” would wear nothing else. The manufacture
of these coarse woollens became an ordinary household occupation,
and what was made in excess of family needs found its way to market.
Governor Moore says, “This I had an opportunity of seeing during my late
tour;... every house swarms with children, who are set to work as soon
as they are able to spin and card; and as every family is furnished with a
loom, the itinerant weavers, who travel about the country, put the finishing
hand to the work.”</p>

<p>The making of beaver hats was an industry in which the colonial competition
with the English hatters led to most oppressive legislation in
Parliament. The middle colonies, particularly from their connection with
the beaver-hunting Indians, had carried the art to a degree which produced
a cheaper if not a better covering for the head than was made in England,
and they found it easy to market them in the West Indies, where they
excluded the English-made article. Accordingly the export of hats from
England fell off so perceptibly that in 1731 the “Master Wardens and
Assistants of the Company of Feltmakers of London” petitioned the
Lords of Trade to order that the inhabitants of the colonies should wear
no hats but such as were made in Great Britain. The prayer was denied,
but Parliament was induced, in 1732, to forbid the exportation of hats
from American ports.</p>

<p>But most trades in the colonies failed of the natural protection which
arises from cheap labor, while the opportunities of acquiring lands and
establishing homes with ample acres about them served further to increase
the difficulties of competition with the Old World, in that artisans
were attracted by lures of this kind to the new settlements, and away
from the shops of the towns.</p>

<p class="p2">The commerce of the colonies easily fell into four different channels: one
took produce to England, or to such foreign lands as the navigation laws
permitted; the second bound the colonies one with the other in the bonds
of reciprocal trade; a third was opened with the Indians; and the fourth
embraced all that surreptitious venture which was known as smuggling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The ports of New York and Philadelphia absorbed the foreign and transatlantic
trade of the middle colonies, notwithstanding the efforts which
New Jersey made to draw a share of it to Perth Amboy. Before Governor
Dongan’s time, ships coming to Amboy had to make entry at New York,
as it was feared that goods brought to the New Jersey port and not paying
New York duties might be smuggled to New York by way of Staten Island.
“Two or three ships came in there [at Amboy] last year,” writes Governor
Dongan in 1687, “with goods, and I am sure that country cannot, even with
West Jersey, consume £1,000 in goods in 2 years, so that the rest must
have been run into this colony.” Some years later the Lords of Trade
decided that the charter did not give to either West or East Jersey the
right to a port of entry, but she, nevertheless, in due time obtained the
right to open such ports at Amboy and Burlington. The displeasure of
the New York authorities was manifest in the refusal of their governor to
make proclamation of such decree, and the larger province was strong
enough occasionally to seize a vessel bound for Amboy. New Jersey could
protest; but her indignation was in vain, and she never succeeded in establishing
a lucrative commerce. How steadily the commerce of her neighbor
increased is shown in the record that in 1737 New York had 53 ships with
an aggregate of 3,215 tons; in 1747, there were 99 ships of 4,313 tons; and
in 1749, 157 with a capacity of 6,406 tons. The records of the New York
custom-house show that the articles imported from abroad or from the other
British colonies on this continent and from the West Indies were principally
rum, madeira wine, cocoa, European goods, and occasionally a negro slave,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
while the exports of the colonies were fish and provisions.</p>

<p>New Jersey had little Atlantic trade, since New York and Philadelphia
could import for her all the European and West India goods which she
needed. In intercolonial trade, however, she had a large share, and she
supplied her neighbors with cereals, beef, and horses. New York, on the
contrary, was sometimes pressed to prevent certain exportations, when
she needed all her productions herself, as was sometimes the case with
cereals. This intercolonial trade naturally grew in the main out of the
products of the several colonies; while for their Indian trade, they were
compelled to use what the avidity of the natives called for,&mdash;blankets,
weapons, rum, and the trinkets with which the Indian was fond of adorning
his person, and for all which he paid almost entirely in furs. The
nature of this traffic was such, particularly in respect to the sale of arms
and spirits, that legislation was often interposed to regulate it in the interest
of peace and justice.</p>

<p>As respects the illegal or last class of commercial channels, we find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
before Bellomont’s time there had grown up, as he found, “a lycencious
trade with pyrats, Scotland and Curaçao,” out of which no customs revenue
was obtained. As a consequence, the city and province of New York
“grew rich, but the customes, they decreased.” Certain Long Island harbors
became “a great Receptacle for Pirates.” The enforcement of the
law gave Bellomont a chance to say, in 1700, that an examination of the entries
in New York and Boston had shown him that the trade of the former
port was almost half as much as that of the other, while New Hampshire
ports had not the tenth part of New York, except in lumber and fish. The
Philadelphia Quakers objected to fight the West Indian enemies of the
crown; but they had little objection to trade with them, and to grow rich
on such more peaceful intercourse.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the period spoken of in this chapter, a “pernicious
trade with Holland” had sprung up, which the colonial governors found
hard to suppress, but which was successfully checked in 1764 by the English
cruisers; but shortly before the War of Independence it began again
to flourish.</p>

<p>A diversity of trade brought in its train a great variety in the coin, which
was its medium, and a generation now living can remember when the great
influx of Spanish coin poured into the colonies in the last century was still
in great measure a circulating medium. The indebtedness to the mother
country which colonists always start with continued for a long while to
drain the colonies of its specie in payment of interest and principal. As
soon as their productions were allowed to find openly or clandestinely a
market in the Spanish main and the West Indies, the return came in the
pieces of eight, the Rix dollars, and all the other varieties of Spanish or
Mexican coinage which passed current in the tropics. So far as these
went to pay debts in Europe, the colonies were forced to preserve primitive
habits of barter in wampum, beaver, and tobacco. By the time of Andros,
foreign trade and the increasing disuse of these articles of barter had begun
to familiarize the people with coin of French and Spanish mintage, and at
that time pieces of eight went for six shillings, double reals for eighteen
pence, pistoles for twenty-four shillings. Soon after this the metal currency
began to be very much diminished in intrinsic value by the practice
of clipping. Both heavy and light pieces were indiscriminately subjected to
this treatment, and the price of the heavier pieces of eight advanced in consequence,
so that in 1693 a standard of weight had to be established, and it
was determined by a proclamation that “whole pieces of eight of the coins
of Sevill, Mexico, and Pillar pieces of 15 pennyweight not plugg’d” should
pass at the rate of 6 shillings; pieces of more weight to increase or lose in
value 4-1/2 pence for each pennyweight more or less. Pieces of eight of Peru
were made current at fourpence for each pennyweight, and Dog dollars at
five shillings sixpence. English coin was of course current in the colonies,
and the emigrants of that day brought their little hoard in the mintage
of their European homes, instead of buying, as to-day, letters of exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
or drafts payable in a currency unknown to them. In 1753 it became necessary
to enact, in New York, a law to prevent the passing of counterfeit
English half-pence and farthings, and in the second half of the last century
the coins mostly current, besides English ones, were the gold Johannis of
eighteen pennyweight, six grains; Moidores of six pennyweight, eighteen
grains; Carolines of six pennyweight, eight grains; Double Loons (Doubloons)
or four Pistoles of seventeen pennyweight, eight grains; double
and single Pistoles; French Guineas (louis d’ors) of five pennyweight,
four grains; and Arabian Chequins of two pennyweight, four grains.</p>

<p>Of the middle colonies, New Jersey was the first to follow Massachusetts
in issuing paper money, which she did by authorizing the issue of £3,000
in bills for the expedition against Canada in 1709.</p>

<p class="p2">The people of the Netherlands and the Belgic provinces had profited as
little under religious persecution as the puritans and separatists of New
England, to become tolerant of other faiths when in the New World they
had the power of control. The laws of New Netherland were favorable
only to the Protestant Reformed Dutch Church, although Swedes and Finns,
who had come to New Sweden on the Delaware, were allowed to worship
according to the Lutheran ritual. The directors of the West India Company,
the supreme authority, did not approve of any religious intolerance,
and expressed themselves forcibly to that effect when Stuyvesant tried to
prosecute members of the Society of Friends. When New York and New
Jersey became English provinces, complete freedom of religion was granted
to them. This drew to them members of all established churches and of
nearly every religious sect of Europe, the latter class largely increased by
such as fled to New York from Massachusetts to enjoy religious toleration.
In 1686, in New York at least, “the most prevailing opinion was that of the
Dutch Calvinists.” How the Roman Catholics were treated has been
shown above. The same reasons which had led to their proscription tried
to impose upon the colonies the Church of England, by directing the governors
not to prefer any minister to an ecclesiastical benefice unless he
was of this order. This royal command to the governors of New York
and New Jersey produced results which its originators probably did not
contemplate. It led to the incorporation of Trinity Church in New York,
with the celebrated and ever-reviving Anneke Jans trials growing out of
it as a fungus, and to the creating a demand for ministers of the Anglican
or Episcopal church which necessitated a school to educate them. This
was the King’s College, known to us of the present day as Columbia
College, chartered in 1754. The non-Episcopalians saw in this movement
the fulfillment of their fears, first aroused by the Ministry Act under
Governor Fletcher in 1693, tending towards the establishment of a
state church. Out of this dread and out of the difficulty in obtaining
ministers for the Dutch Reformed Church grew another educational institution,
the Queen’s College, now known as Rutgers College, in New Brunswick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
N. J. Another institution preceded it, the College of New Jersey at
Princeton. This was first founded by charter from President Hamilton in
1746, and enlarged by Governor Belcher in 1747, who left, by will, to its
library a considerable number of books. The proprietors of Pennsylvania,
always thoughtful of the weal of their subjects, gave, in 1753, $15,000 to a
charitable school and academy, founded four years before in Philadelphia
by public subscription. Two years later, in 1755, it grew into the “College,
Academy, and Charitable School of Philadelphia,” by an act of incorporation,
and to-day it is the “University of Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>Urged thereto by the founder of the independence of the Netherlands,
William the Silent, Prince of Orange, the states-general had adopted in the
sixteenth century the system of universal education, which, in our days, the
New England States claim as their creation. Hence we find schools mentioned
and schoolmasters at work from the beginning of the New Netherland;
and though at first no classics were taught, even at so early a date as
1663 we read of a government schoolmaster who taught Greek and Latin.
The assembly of New York passed, in 1702, an act for the encouragement
of a free grammar school, and favored generally the primary education of
the children of their constituents. New Jersey did not lag in the good
work. In 1765 she had 192 churches of all denominations except the
Roman Catholic, and we may safely suppose that a school was connected
with nearly every church. The Moravians of Pennsylvania imitated the
example set to them at home, and established boarding-schools at Nazareth,
Bethlehem, and Litiz. The small number of schools among the “Dissenters,”
as the Rev. Samuel Johnson calls all non-Episcopalians, induced
him, however, to say, in 1759, that “ministers and schools are much wanted
in Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p class="p2">I. <span class="smcap">The Manuscript Sources of New York History.</span> (<i>By Mr. Fernow.</i>)&mdash;New
York has taken the lead among the American States in the extent of the printed records
of her history.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> In the archives at Albany there are certain manuscript documents
illustrating the period now under consideration deserving mention.</p>

<p>“When first his Royall Highnesse, the Duke of York, took possession of this Province
[New York], he ... gave him [Gov<sup>r</sup> Nicolls] certain Laws, by which the Province was to
be governed.” Several copies of these, <i>Duke’s Laws</i> (1674), were made, and they were
sent to the different districts, Long Island, Delaware, the Esopus, and Albany, into which
the province was then divided.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The so-called <i>Dongan’s Laws</i> (1683 and 1684) make a manuscript volume, containing
the laws enacted by the first general assembly of the province during the years 1683 and
1684. It has upon its original parchment cover a second title, evidently written at a later
date: “The Duke of York’s Charter of Liberty &amp; Priviledges to the Inhabitants of New
York, anno 1683, with Acts of Assembly of that year &amp; the year 1684.” The laws are
mainly a reënactment of the Duke’s Laws, and are now deposited in the State library.
They have never been printed.</p>

<p>The <i>Original Colonial Laws</i> (1684-1775) make nineteen volumes of manuscripts, now
in the office of the secretary of state at Albany, of which such as had not in the mean
time expired by their own limitation were printed in 1694,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> 1710, and 1726, by William
Bradford; in 1719 by Baskett; in 1762 by Livingston and Smith; in 1768 by Parker, and
in 1773 by Van Schaack. The Bradford edition of 1710 contains also the journal of the
general assembly, etc.</p>

<p>Those <i>Bills which failed to become Laws</i> (1685-1732) make three volumes of manuscript,
and though the measures proposed never became operative they show the drift
of public opinion during the period covered by them. Several of these bills have been
bound into the volumes of laws.</p>

<p>The student of colonial commerce and finances will find much to interest him in other
manuscript volumes, now in the State library at Albany, to wit: <i>Accounts of the Treasurer
of the Province</i>, under various titles, and covering the period from 1702 to 1776,
eight volumes, and <i>Manifest Books and Entry Books of the New York Custom House</i>,
1728 to 1774, forty-three volumes. Much information coveted by the genealogist is
hidden in the <i>Indentures of Palatine Children</i>, 1710 and 1711, two volumes; in forty
volumes of <i>Marriage Bonds</i>, 1752 to 1783, of which an index was published in 1860 under
the title <i>New York Marriages</i>; and in the records kept in the office of the clerk of
the Court of Appeals,&mdash;<i>Files of Wills</i>, from 1694 to 1800, and of <i>Inventories</i>, 1727 to
1798.</p>

<p>Out of the 28 volumes of <i>Council Minutes</i>, 1668 to 1783, everything relating to the
legislative business before the council has been published by the State of New York in
the <i>Journal of the Provincial Council</i>. The unpublished parts of these records&mdash;the
seven volumes of “Warrants of Survey, Licenses to Purchase Indian Lands,” 1721 to
1766, the fourteen “Books of Patents,” 1664 to 1770, the nineteen “Books of Deeds,”
1659 to 1774, and the thirty-four volumes of “Land Papers,” from 1643 to 1775&mdash;give
as complete a history of the way in which the colony of New York gained its population
as at this day it is possible to obtain without following the many private histories of
real estate. The above-mentioned “Books of Deeds” contain papers of miscellaneous
character, widely differing from deeds, such as commissions, letters of denization, licenses
of schoolmasters, etc. Of the “Land Papers” a <i>Calendar</i> was published by the
State in 1864.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>A public-spirited citizen of Albany, General John Tayler Cooper, enriched in 1850 the
State library with twenty-two volumes of manuscripts, containing the correspondence of
Sir William Johnson, the Indian commissioner. This correspondence covers the period
from 1738 to 1774, and is important for the political, Indian, social, and religious history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of New York. Extracts from it appeared in Dr. O’Callaghan’s <i>Documentary History
of New York</i> (vol. ii.).<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>Less important for the period treated of in this chapter are the <i>Clinton Papers</i>, especially
the later series; but of the first importance in the study of the French wars
are the <i>Letters of Colonel John Bradstreet</i>, deputy quartermaster-general, and <i>The Letters
of General Sir Jeffrey Amherst</i>, commander-in-chief in America, dated New York,
Albany, etc., from 1755 to 1771, a manuscript volume presented to the State library by
the Rev. Wm. B. Sprague, D. D.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>An <i>Abridgment of the Records of Indian Affairs, transacted in the Colony of New
York from 1678 to 1751</i>, with a preface by the compiler, is the work of Peter Wraxall,
secretary for Indian affairs. It is a manuscript of 224 pages, dated at New York, May
10, 1754.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> It is to be regretted that Wraxall’s complete record of these transactions has
not been preserved, as the few extracts of them handed down to us in the <i>Council Minutes</i>
and in the <i>Documents relating to the Colonial History of New York</i> give us a great
deal of curious and interesting information.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>The religious life in the colony of New York during the early part of the eighteenth
century, as seen from the Episcopal point of view, is well depicted in a manuscript
volume (107 pp. folio), <i>Extracts from Correspondence of the Venerable Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts with the Missionaries T. Payer, S. Seabury,
and others, from 1704 to 1709</i>.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The history of trade and business is likewise illustrated
in the <i>Commercial Letters</i> of the firm P. &amp; R. Livingston, New York and Albany, from
1733 to 1738, and of Boston and Philadelphia merchants during the same period, giving
us a picture of mercantile transactions at that time which a number of account-books
of N. De Peyster, treasurer of the colony and merchant in the city of New York, and of
the firm of Beverley Robinson &amp; Morrison Malcom, in Fredericksburg, now Patterson,
Putnam County, N. Y., help to fill out.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>A German geographer, well known in the early years of the eighteenth century, was
Johann Baptist Homann, who, having been a monk, turned Protestant and cartographer,
and at nearly forty years of age set up, in 1702, as a draftsman and publisher of maps at
Nuremberg,<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> giving his name till his death, in 1724, to about two hundred maps.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Homann’s
career was a successful one; he became, in 1715, a member of the Academy of
Science at Berlin, and was made the official geographer of the Emperor Charles of Germany
and of Peter the Great of Russia. A son succeeded to the business in 1724, and,
on his death in 1730, the imprint of the family was continued by “the heirs of Homann,”
at the hands of some university friends of the son. Under this authority we find a
map, <i>Die Gross Britannischen Colonial Laender in Nord-America in Special Mappen</i>
(<i>Homannsche Erben</i>, Nuremberg), in which nearly the whole of New York is called
“Gens Iroquois,” or “Irokensium.”</p>

<p>Contemporary with the elder Homann, the English geographer Herman Moll was publishing
his maps in London;<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and of his drafting were the maps which accompanied
Thomas Salmon’s <i>Modern History or the State of all Nations</i>, first issued between
1725 and 1739.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> His map of New England and the middle colonies is not carried farther
west than the Susquehanna.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the great map of Henry Popple in 1732,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> and of the
maps of the contemporary French geographer D’Anville;<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> but their phenomenal labors
were long in getting possession through the popular compends of the public mind. We
find little of their influence, for instance, in the <i>Gazetteer’s or Newsman’s Interpreter,
being a geographical Index of all the Empires, Kingdoms, Islands, etc., in Africa, Asia,
and America</i>. <i>By Laurence Echard, A. M., of Christ’s College, Cambridge</i> (London,
1741).<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> In this New York is made to adjoin Maryland, and is traversed by the Hudson,
Raritan, and Delaware rivers; New Jersey lies between 39 and 40° N. L., and is
bounded on the east by Hudson’s Bay; and Pennsylvania lies between 40 and 43° N. L.,
but no bounds are given.</p>

<p>The French geographer’s drafts, however, were made the basis in 1752 of a map in
Postlethwayt’s <i>Dictionary of Commerce</i>, which was entitled <i>North America, performed
under the patronage of Louis, Duke of Orleans, First Prince of the Blood, by the Sieur
d’Anville, greatly improved by M. Bolton</i>.</p>

<p>The maps which, three years later (1755), grew out of the controversies in America on
the boundary claims of France and England have been definitely classified in another
place,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> and perhaps the limit of the English pretensions was reached in <i>A New and Accurate
Map of the English Empire in North America, representing their Rightful Claim,
as confirmed by Charters and the formal Surrender of their Indian Friends, likewise
the Encroachments of the French, etc. By a Society of Anti-Gallicans. Published according
to Act of Parliament, Decbr., 1755, and sold by W<sup>m</sup>. Herbert on London Bridge and
Robert Sayer over against Fetter Lane in Fleet Street</i>. This map is of some importance
in defining the location of the Indian tribes and towns.</p>

<p>The English influence is also apparent in a reissue of D’Anville, made at Nuremberg
by the Homann publishing house the next year: <i>America Septentrionalis a Domino
D’Anville in Gallia edita, nunc in Anglia Coloniis in Inferiorem Virginiam deductis
nec non Fluvii Ohio cursu aucta, etc., Sumptibus Homanniorum Heredum, Noribergiæ,
1756</i>.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> It makes the province of New York stretch westerly to Lake Michigan.</p>

<p class="p2">Respecting the special maps of New York province, a particular interest attaches to
<i>The Map of the Country of the Five Nations</i>, printed by Bradford in 1724, which was the
first map engraved in New York. The <i>Brinley Catal.</i> (ii. no. 3,384, 3,446) shows the map
in two states, apparently of the same year (1724). It originally accompanied Cadwallader
Colden’s <i>Papers relating to an Act of the Province of New York for the encouragement
of the Indian trade</i>. It was reëngraved from the first state for the London ed. of Colden’s
Five Nations, in 1747, and from this plate it has been reproduced on another page
(chapter viii.).<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>Another of Colden’s maps, made by him as surveyor-general of the province, exists in
a mutilated state in the State library at Albany, showing the regions bordering on the
Hudson and Mohawk rivers. It was drafted by him probably at the end of the first
quarter of the eighteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> and fac-similes of parts of it are annexed (pp. 236, 237).</p>

<p>A map of the northern parts of the province, called <i>Carte du Lac Champlain depuis le
Fort Chambly jusqu’au Fort St. Frédéric, levée par le Sieur Anger, arpenteur du Roy
en 1732, faite à Québec, le 10 Octobre, 1748, signé de Lery</i>, indicates the attempted introduction
of a feudal system of land tenure by the French. The map is reproduced in
O’Callaghan’s <i>Doc. Hist. of New York</i>.</p>

<p>The province of New York to its western bounds is shown in <i>A Map of New England
and ye Country adjacent, by a gentleman, who resided in those parts</i>. <i>Sold by W. Owen</i>
(London, 1755).</p>

<p>The New York State library has also a manuscript <i>Map of part of the province of New
York on Hudson’s River, the West End of Nassau Island, and part of New Jersey.
Compiled pursuant to order of the Earl of Loudoun, Septbr. 17, 1757</i>. <i>Drawn by Captain
[Samuel J.] Holland.</i> This is a map called by the Lords of Trade in 1766 “a very accurate
and useful survey, ... in which the most material patents are marked and their
boundaries described.”</p>

<p>Something of the extension of settlements in the Mohawk Valley at this period can
be learned from a manuscript <i>Map of the Country between Mohawk River and Wood
Creek, with the Fortifications and buildings thereon in 1758</i>, likewise preserved in the
State library.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>A drawn map of New York province and adjacent parts (1759), from Maj. Christie’s
surveys, is noted in the <i>King’s Maps</i> (Brit. Mus.), ii. 527.</p>

<p>The boundary controversy between New York and New Jersey has produced a long
discussion over the successive developments of the historical geography of that part of
the middle colonies. An important map on the subject is a long manuscript roll (5 × 2-6/12
feet), preserved in Harvard College library, which has been photographed by the regents
of the University of the State of New York, and entitled <i>A copy of the general map, the
most part compiled from actual survey by order of the commissioners appointed to settle
the partition line between the provinces of New York and New Jersey</i>. 1769. <i>By Ber<sup>d</sup>.
Ratzer.</i> [New York, 1884.] 7-5/8 × 12-3/4 in.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>Of the special maps of Pennsylvania, the Holme map a little antedates the period
of our survey.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The Gabriel Thomas map of Pennsylvania and New Jersey appeared

<p>About 1740, in a tract printed at London, <i>In Chancery. Breviate. John Penn, Thomas

in the year 1740</i>. The controversy over this boundary is followed in chapter iv. of the
present volume.</p>

<p><i>A map of Philadelphia and parts adjacent, by N. Scull and G. Heap</i>, was published
in 1750, of which there is a fac-simile (folding) in Scharf and Westcott’s <i>Philadelphia</i>,
vol. i.</p>

<p>The annexed fac-simile (p. 239) is from a plate in the <i>London Mag.</i>, Dec., 1756.</p>

<p>A map to illustrate the Indian purchases, made by the proprietary, is given in <i>An Enquiry

<p>Surpassing all previous drafts was a <i>Map of the Improved Part of Pennsylvania, by
Nicholas Scull, published in 1759, and sold by the author in Second Street, Philadelphia.
Engraved by Jas. Turner</i>. It was reproduced in Jefferys’ <i>General Topography of North
America</i> (Nos. 40-42), and was reissued in London in 1770, and again as <i>A Map of
Pennsylvania, exhibiting not only the improved parts of the Province, but also its extensive
frontiers, laid down from actual surveys, and chiefly from the late Map of N.
Scull, published in 1770. Robert Sayer &amp; Bennett</i> (London, 1775). The edition of
1770 was reëngraved in Paris by Le Rouge.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Leisler Papers constitute the first volume
of the Fund Publications of the <i>N. Y. Hist. Society’s
Collections</i>, and embrace the journal of
the council from April 27 to June 6, 1689 (procured
from the English State Paper Office),
with letters, etc., and a reprint of a tract in defence
of Leisler, issued at Boston in 1698, and
called <i>Loyalty Vindicated, being an answer to a
late false, seditious, and scandalous pamphlet, entitled
“A letter from a Gent,” etc.</i><a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> The <i>Sparks
Catal.</i> (p. 217) shows a MS. copy made of a rare
tract in the British Museum, printed in New
York and reprinted in London, 1690, called <i>A
modest and impartial narrative of the great oppressions
that the inhabitants of their majestie’s
Province of New York lye under by the extravagant
and arbitrary proceedings of Jacob Leisler
and his accomplices</i>. Sparks endorsed his copy
as “written by a violent enemy to Leisler; neither
just, candid, nor impartial.”<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Various papers
relating to the administration of Leisler
make a large part of the second volume of the
<i>Documentary History of New York</i>, showing the
letters written by Leisler to Boston, the papers
connected with his official proceedings in New
York, and his communications with the adjacent
colonies; the council minutes in Dec., 1689; proceedings
against the French and Indians; the
papers relating to the transfer of the fort and arrest
of Leisler; the dying speeches of Leisler
and Milbourne; with a reprint of <i>A letter from
a gentleman of the city of New York to another</i>
(New York, 1698). There are a few original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
letters of Leisler in the<i> Prince Letters</i> (MSS.),
1686-1700, in Mass. Hist. Soc. cabinet.</p>

<p>The career of Leisler is traced in the memoir
by C. F. Hoffman in Sparks’s <i>Amer. Biog.</i>, xiii.
(1844), and in G. W. Schuyler’s <i>Colonial New
York</i> (i. 337). Peleg W. Chandler examines
the records of the prosecution in his <i>American
Criminal Trials</i> (i. 255). Cf. also <i>Historical
Magazine</i>, xxi. 18, and the general histories, of
which Dunlap’s gives the best account among
the earlier ones.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The student must, of necessity, have recourse
to the general histories of New York for the successive
administrations of the royal governors,
and H. B. Dawson, in his <i>Sons of Liberty</i>
(printed as manuscript, 1859), has followed the
tracks of the constant struggle on their part to
preserve their prerogatives.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Schuyler (<i>Colonial
New York</i>, i. 394-460) follows pretty closely the
administration of Fletcher. The chapter on
New England (<i>ante</i>, no. ii.) will need to be parallelized
with this for the career of Bellomont.</p>

<p>Under Nanfan, who succeeded Bellomont
temporarily, Col. Bayard, who had brought Leisler
to his doom, was in turn put on trial, and
the narrative of the proceedings throws light on
the factious political life of the time.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>One of the most significant acts of Cornbury’s
rule (1702-1708) was the prosecution in 1707 of
Francis Mackemie, a Presbyterian minister, for
preaching without a license.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>J. R. Brodhead, who gives references in the
case (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, Nov., 1863), charges Cornbury
with forging the clause of his instructions
under which it was attempted to convict Mackemie,
and he says that the copy of the royal instructions
in the State Paper Office contains no
such paragraph. “History,” he adds, “has
already exhibited Lord Cornbury as a mean
liar, a vulgar profligate, a frivolous spendthrift,
an impudent cheat, a fraudulent bankrupt, and
a detestable bigot. He is convicted of having
perpetrated one of the most outrageous forgeries
ever attempted by a British nobleman.”<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>The few months of Lovelace’s rule (1708-9)
were followed by a funeral <i>Sermon</i> when he died,
in May, 1709, preached by William Vesey (New
York, 1709), which is of enough historical interest
to have been reprinted in the <i>N. Y. Hist.
Coll.</i> (1880).</p>

<p>During 1720-1722, the Shelburne Papers
(<i>Hist. MSS. Commission Report</i>, v. 215) reveal
letters of Peter Schuyler and Gov. Burnet, with
various other documentary sources.</p>

<p>There is a portrait of Rip van Dam, with a
memoir, in Valentine’s <i>Manual</i> (1864, p. 713).</p>

<p>The main printed source respecting the Negro
Plot of 1741 is the very scarce book by the recorder
of the city of New York, Daniel Horsmanden,
<i>A Journal of the proceedings in the Detection
of the Conspiracy formed by some white
people in conjunction with negro and other slaves
for burning the City of New York, and murdering
the inhabitants, etc., containing</i>, I., <i>a narrative
of the trials, executions, etc.</i>; II., <i>evidence come to
light since their execution</i>; III., <i>lives of the several
persons committed, etc.</i> (New York, 1744).<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The history of Pennsylvania during this period
is a tale of the trials of Penn,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> the misgovernment
of the province by representatives of
the proprietors, the struggles of the proprietary
party against the people, the apathy of the Quakers
in the face of impending war, and the determination
of the assembly to make the proprietors
bear their share of the burdens of defence.
The published <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i> give much
of the documentary evidence, and the general
histories tell the story.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Hist. Soc., in vols. ix. and
x. of their <i>Memoirs</i>, published the correspondence
of Penn with Logan, his secretary in the
colony, beginning in 1700. This collection also
embraced the letters of various other writers, all
appertaining to the province, and was first arranged
by the wife of a grandson of James Logan
in 1814; but a project soon afterwards entertained
by the American Philosophical Society
of printing the papers from Mrs. Logan’s copies
was not carried out, and finally this material
was placed by that society at the disposal
of the Penna. Hist. Society. The
correspondence was used by Janney in his
<i>Life of Penn</i>, and liberal extracts were
printed in <i>The Friend</i> (Philadelphia, July,
1842-Apr., 1846) by Mr. Alfred Cope. Mr. Edward
Armstrong, the editor of the Historical
Society’s volumes, gathered additional materials
from other and different sources. A portrait
of Logan is given in the second volume, which
brings the correspondence down to 1711. The
material exists for continuing the record to 1750,
though Logan ceased to hold official connection
with the province in 1738.</p>

<p>Sparks (<i>Franklin’s Works</i>, vii. 25) says that
“a history of James Logan’s public life would
be that of Pennsylvania during the first forty
years of the last century.” See the account of
Logan in the <i>Penn and Logan Correspondence</i>,
vol. i.</p>

<p>The correspondence of Thomas and Richard
Penn with a later agent in Philadelphia, Richard
Peters, is also preserved. In 1861 this correspondence
was in the possession of Mr. John W.
Field, of Philadelphia, when Mr. Charles Eliot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Norton gave transcripts of a portion of it (letters
between 1750 and 1758) to the Mass. Hist. Society.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>Of an earlier period, when Evans was deputy-governor,
there are some characteristic letters
(1704, etc.) in a memoir of Evans communicated
by E. D. Neill to the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i>, Oct., 1872 (p. 421).</p>

<p>There is a biographical sketch of Sir William
Keith in the Penna. Historical Society’s <i>Memoirs</i>
(vol. i.).</p>

<p>There is a pencil-drawn portrait of Sir William
Keith, with a painting made from it, in the
gallery of the Penna. Hist. Society. Cf. <i>Catal.
of Paintings, etc.</i> (nos. 77, 162), and Scharf and
Westcott’s <i>Philadelphia</i> (i. 177). Some of the
rare tracts in the controversy of Governor Keith
and Logan are noted in the <i>Brinley Catal.</i>, ii.
pp. 197-8. Cf. Hildeburn’s <i>Century of Printing</i>.</p>

<p>As to the position of the Quakers upon the
question of defensive war, there is an expressive
letter, dated in 1741, of James Logan, who
was not in this respect a strict constructionist of
the principles of his sect, which is printed in the
<i>Penna. Mag. of History</i> (vi. 402). Much of this
controversy over military preparation is illustrated
in the autobiography and lives of Benjamin
Franklin; and the issues of Franklin’s <i>Plain
Truth</i> (1747) and Samuel Smith’s <i>Necessary
Truth</i>, the most significant pamphlets in the
controversy, are noted in the bibliographies.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
Sparks, in a preliminary note to a reprint of <i>Plain
Truth</i>, in <i>Franklin’s Works</i> (vol. iii.), states the
circumstances which were the occasion and the
sequel of its publication. In <i>Ibid.</i> (vii. 20) there
is a letter of Richard Peters describing the condition
of affairs.</p>

<p>A mass of papers, usually referred to as the
Shippen Papers, and relating to a period in the
main antedating the Revolution, have been edited
privately by Thomas Balch as <i>Letters and
Papers relating chiefly to the Provincial History
of Pennsylvania, with some notices of the writers</i>.
(Philad., 1855, one hundred copies.)</p>

<p class="p2">First of importance among the published travels
of this period is the narrative of an English
Quaker, Thomas Story, who came over in 1697.
From that time to 1708 he visited every part of
the colonies from New Hampshire to Carolina,
dwelling for much of the time, however, in Pennsylvania,
where he became, under Penn’s persuasion,
a public official. The <i>Journal of the
life of Thomas Story, containing an account of his
remarkable convincement of and embracing the
principles of truth, as held by the people called
Quakers, and also of his travels and labours in
the service of the Gospel, with many other occurrences
and observations</i>, was published at Newcastle-upon-Tyne
in 1747.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>George Clarke, born in 1676, was made secretary
of the province of New York in 1703, and
came to America, landing in Virginia. We have
an account of his voyage, but unfortunately the
book does not follow his experiences after his arrival;<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
but we have the <i>Letters</i> of his private
secretary, Isaac Bobin, which, under the editing
of Dr. O’Callaghan, were printed in a small edition
(100 copies) at Albany in 1872.</p>

<p>George Keith’s <i>Journal of Travels from New
Hampshire to Caratuck, on the Continent of North
America</i>, London, 1706, is reprinted in the first
volume (1851) of the <i>Collections of the Prot.
Episc. Hist. Society</i>, together with various letters
of Keith<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> and John Talbot.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>Benjamin Holme, another Quaker, came to
the colonies in 1715, and extended his missionary
wandering to New England, and southward
beyond the middle colonies,<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> as did, some years
later, 1736-1737, still another Quaker, John Griffeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
whose <i>Journal of his life, labours, and travels
in the work of the ministry</i> passed through
many editions, both in America and Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>The records of missionary efforts at this time
are not wholly confined to the Quakers. The
narrative of the Rev. Thomas Thompson reveals
the perplexities of the adherents of the Established
Church in the communities through which
he travelled in the Jerseys.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Similar records
are preserved in the journals of Whitefield<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> and
his associates, like the <i>Journal of a Voyage from
Savannah to Philadelphia and from Philadelphia
to England, MDCCXL., by William Seward,
Gent., Companion in Travel with the Reverend
Mr. George Whitefield</i> (London, 1740).</p>

<p>We have a few German experiences, among
them Gottlieb Mittelberger’s <i>Reise nach Pennsylvanien
im Jahr 1750 und Rŭkreise nach Teutschland
im Jahr 1754</i> (Stuttgart, 1756)<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>&mdash;which is
the record of a German teacher and organist,
who was in the province for three years. He
had no very flattering notion of the country as
an asylum for such Germans as, having indentured
themselves for their passage, found on their
arrival that they could be passed on from master
to master, not always with much regard to their
happiness.</p>

<p>Michael Schlatter, a Dutch preacher, published
his observations of the country and population,
and particularly as to the condition of the
Dutch Reformed churches. He was in the country
from 1746 to 1751, and made his report to
the Synod of Holland. Though the book pertains
mostly to Pennsylvania, his experiences
extended to New York and New England.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>We have the reports of a native observer in
the <i>Observations on the inhabitants, climate, soil,
rivers, productions, animals, and other matters
worthy of notice, made by Mr. John Bartram in
his travels from Pensilvania to Onondago, Oswego,
and the lake Ontario in Canada</i>. <i>To which
is annexed a curious account of the Cataracts at
Niagara, by Mr. Peter Kalm</i> (London, 1751).<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
Bartram was born in Pennsylvania, and made
this journey in company with Conrad Weiser,
the agent sent by Pennsylvania to hold friendly
conference with the Iroquois, as explained in
another chapter.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Bartram’s principal object
was the study of the flora of the country, in
which pursuit he acquired such a reputation as
to attract the notice of Linnæus, but his record
throws light upon the people which came in
his way, and enable us in some respects to understand
better their manners and thoughts.
Evans’ map, already mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> was in part
the outgrowth of this journey.</p>

<p>We also owe to the friendly interest of the
great Swedish botanist the observations of Peter
Kalm, a countryman of Linnæus, whom the
Swedish government sent to America on a botanical
tour in 1748-1751. He extended his
journeys to Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada,
and we have in his three volumes, beside
his special studies, not a little of his comment on
men and events. He published his <i>En risa til
Norra America</i> at Stockholm, 1753-1761. (Sabin,
ix. 36,986.)<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rev. Andrew Burnaby’s <i>Travels through
the middle settlements in North America in 1759-1760,
with observations upon the state of the Colonies</i>,
was published in London, 1775.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Burnaby
was an active observer and used his note-book,
so that little escaped him, whether of the people’s
character or their manners, or the aspect of
the towns they dwelt in, or of the political and
social movements which engaged them.</p>

<p class="p2">The relations of the middle colonies to the
Indians will be particularly illustrated in a later
chapter on the military aspects of the French
wars,<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> but there are a few special works which
may be mentioned here: Colden’s <i>Five Indian
Nations</i> (only to 1697); Morgan’s <i>League of the
Iroquois</i>; Wm. L. Stone’s <i>Life of Sir William
Johnson</i>; and Geo. W. Schuyler’s <i>Colonial New
York&mdash;Peter Schuyler and his family</i> (Albany,
1885). The successive generations of the Schuylers
had for a long period been practical intermediaries
between the colonists and the Indians.
Something of the Indian relations in Bellomont’s
time is indicated elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> For the agreement
between William Penn and the Susquehanna
Indians in 1701, see the <i>Penna. Archives</i> (i. 145).
Of similar records in Cornbury’s time, Schuyler
(ii. 17) says the remains are meagre, but he gives
more for Hunter’s time (ii. pp. 42-79) and Burnet’s
(ii. p. 83). The Shelburne Papers (<i>Hist.
MSS. Commission Report</i>, v.) reveal various documents
from 1722 to 1724, and there is a MS. of
a treaty between the governors of New York,
Virginia, and Pennsylvania (Albany, Sept., 1722)
in the library of Harvard College.</p>

<p>For the treaty of 1735, see the <i>Penna. Mag. of
Hist.</i> (vii. 215).</p>

<p>For 1742 there was a treaty with the Six Nations
at Philadelphia, and its text was printed
at London.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>In 1747 there were treaties in July at Lancaster,
Penna., with the Six Nations, and on Nov.
13 with the Ohio Indians at Philadelphia. (Haven
in Thomas, ii. 497.) Again, in July, 1753,
Johnson had a conference with the Mohawks
(2 <i>Penna. Archives</i>, vi. 150); and in Oct. a
treaty with the Ohio Indians was made at Carlisle
(Hildeburn, i. 1328; Haven, p. 517). There
exist also minutes of conferences held at Easton,
Oct., 1758, with the Mohawks;<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> at Easton, Aug.,
1761, with the Five Nations; and in Aug., 1762,
at Lancaster, with the northern and western
Indians. (Hildeburn, i. 1593, 1634, 1748, 1908.)</p>

<p>The Moravians, settling first in Georgia, had
founded Bethlehem in Pennsylvania in 1741, and
soon extended the field of their labors into New
York;<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> and in no way did the characteristics of
this people impress the life of the colonies so
much as in the intermediary nature of their
missions among the Indians. David Zeisberger
was a leading spirit in this work, and left a manuscript
account (written in 1778 in German) of the
missions, which was discovered by Schweinitz
in the archives of the Moravian church at Bethlehem.
(Schweinitz’s <i>Zeisberger</i>, p. 29.) It
proved to be the source upon which Loskiel
had depended for the first part of his <i>History
of the Mission of the United Brethren among the
Indians in North America, in three parts, by
Geo. H. Loskiel, translated from the German by
Christian Ignatius Latrobe</i> (London, 1794);<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
and Schweinitz found it of invaluable use to
him in the studies for his <i>Life of David Zeisberger</i>
(Philad., 1870). The other principal authority
on the work of the Moravians among the
Indians is Rev. John Heckewelder, whose <i>Narrative
of the Mission of the United Brethren</i>
(Philad., 1820) has been elsewhere referred to,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
and who also published <i>An account of the History,
Manners, and Customs of the Indian Nations
who once inhabited Pennsylvania and the
neighboring States</i> (Philad., 1818).<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> Schweinitz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
also refers to another manuscript upon the Indians,
preserved in the library of the American
Philosophical Society, by Christopher Pyrlaeus,
likewise a Moravian missionary.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> We have again
from Spangenberg an <i>Account of the manner in
which the Protestant Church of the Unitas Fratrum
preach the Gospel and carry on their missions
among the heathen</i> (English transl., London,
1788); and his notes of travel to Onondaga,
in 1745, which are referred to in the original MS.
by Schweinitz (<i>Zeisberger</i>, p. 132), have since
been printed in the <i>Penna. Mag. of History</i> (vol.
iii.).<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most distinguished of the English
missionaries was David Brainerd, a native
of Connecticut, of whose methods and their results,
as he went among the Indians of Pennsylvania
and New Jersey, we have the record
in his life and diaries.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The question of the population of the middle
colonies during the eighteenth century is complicated
somewhat by the heterogeneous compounding
of nationalities, particularly in Pennsylvania.
In New Jersey the people were more
purely English than in New York. We find
brought together the statistics of the population
of New York, 1647-1774, in the <i>Doc. Hist. of
N. Y.</i> (i. 687), and Lodge (<i>English Colonies</i>, p.
312) collates some of the evidence. The German
element in New York is exemplified in F.
Kapp’s <i>Die Deutschen im Staate New York während
des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts</i>. (New York,
1884.)</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania the Swedes were beginning
to lose in number when the century opened, and
the Dutch were also succumbing to the English
preponderance; but there were new-comers in
the Welsh and Germans in sufficient numbers
to keep the characteristics of the people very
various.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Religion had brought the earliest Germans,&mdash;Dunkers<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
and Mennonists,<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> all industrious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
but ignorant. By 1719 the Irish began
to come, in part a desirable stock, the Scotch-Irish
Presbyterians; but in large numbers they
were as unpromising as the dregs of a race
could make them. The rise of Presbyterianism
in Pennsylvania is traced in C. A. Briggs’s
<i>Amer. Presbyterianism</i> (New York, 1885).<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>The influx of other than English into Pennsylvania
in the eighteenth century had an extent best
measured by <i>A collection of upwards of 30,000
names of German, Swiss, Dutch, French, and
other immigrants in Pennsylvania, 1727-1776,
with notes and an appendix containing lists of
more than one thousand German and French in
New York prior to 1712</i>, by Professor I. Daniel
Rupp (2d enlarged ed., Philad., 1876).</p>

<p>Respecting the Welsh immigrants, compare
the <i>Pennsylvania Mag. of Hist.</i>, i. 330; Howard
M. Jenkins’s <i>Historical collections relating to
Gwynedd, a township of Montgomery County,
Penn., settled, 1698, by Welsh immigrants, with
some data referring to the adjoining township of
Montgomery, also a Welsh settlement</i> (Phila.,
1884), and J. Davis’s <i>History of the Welsh Baptists</i>
(Pittsburgh, 1835).</p>

<p>The Huguenot emigration to the middle colonies,
particularly to New York, is well studied
in C. W. Baird’s <i>Huguenot Emigration to America</i>
(1885). Cf. references <i>ante</i>, p. 98; and for
special monographs, W. W. Waldron’s <i>Huguenots
of Westchester and Parish of Fordham, with
an introduction by S. H. Tyng</i> (New York, 1864),
and G. P. Disosway on the Huguenots of Staten
Island, in the <i>Continental Monthly</i>, i. 683, and
his app. on “The Huguenots in America” to
Samuel Smiles’s <i>Huguenots</i> (N. Y., 1868).</p>

<p class="p2">The best summary of the manners and social
and intellectual life of the middle colonies will
be found in Lodge’s <i>Short History of the English
Colonies</i> (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania),
and he fortifies his varied statements
with convenient references. For New York
specially the best known picture of life is Mrs.
Anne Grant’s <i>Memoirs of an American Lady</i>,<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
but its recollections, recorded in late life, of
experiences of childhood, have nearly taken it
out of the region of historical truth. For Pennsylvania
there is a rich store of illustration in
Watson’s <i>Annals of Philadelphia</i>, and much
help will be derived from the <i>Penn and Logan
Letters</i>, printed by the Penna. Hist. Soc.;<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> from
the journal of William Black, a Virginian, who
recorded his observations in 1744, printed in the
<i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i> (vols. i. and ii.).<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>The exigencies of the Indian wars, while they
colored the life and embroiled the politics of
the time, induced the search for relief from pecuniary
burdens, here as in New England, in the
issue of paper money, which in turn in its depreciation
grew to be a factor of itself in determining
some social conditions.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>The educational aspects of the middle colonies
have been summarily touched by Lodge in
his <i>English Colonies</i>. Each of them had founded
a college. An institution begun at Elizabethtown
in 1741, was transferred to Princeton in
1757, and still flourishes.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> In 1750 the Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of Philadelphia made the beginning of the
present University of Pennsylvania. In 1754
King’s College in New York city began its mission,&mdash;the
present Columbia College.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>The development of the intellectual life of
the middle colonies, so far as literary results&mdash;such
as they were&mdash;are concerned, is best seen
in Moses C. Tyler’s <i>History of American Literature</i>
(vol. ii. ch. 16).<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> The list by Haven
in Thomas’s <i>Hist. of Printing</i> (vol. ii.) reveals
the extent of the publications of the period; but
for Pennsylvania the record is made admirably
full in Charles R. Hildeburn’s <i>Century of Printing,&mdash;issues
of the press in Pennsylvania, 1685-1784</i>.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>William Bradford, the father of printing in
the middle colonies, removed to New York in
1693, where he died in 1752, having maintained
the position of the leading printer in that province,
where he started, in 1725, the <i>N. Y. Gazette</i>,
the earliest New York newspaper.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> His son,
Andrew Bradford (born 1686, died 1742), was the
founder of the newspaper press in Pennsylvania,
and began the <i>American Weekly Mercury</i> in
1719, and the <i>American Magazine</i> in 1741.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>The records of the publication of Franklin
and his press have been more than once carefully
made,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> and Col. William Bradford, grandson of
the first William, has been fitly commemorated
in the <i>Life</i> of him by Wallace.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the histories of Philadelphia, since
the memoranda were noted in Vol. III. (p. 509),
the material gathered by Thompson Westcott
has been augmented by the labors of Col. J.
Thomas Scharf, and the elaborate <i>History of
Philadelphia</i> (Philad., 1884) with this joint authorship

Two chapters (xiii. and xv.) in the first volume
cover in the main the period now dealt with.
There is still a good deal to be gleaned from
the old <i>Annals of Philadelphia</i>, by John F. Watson,
of which there is a new edition, with revisions
and additions by Willis P. Hazard.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> It

     <p class="pf400">The views of New York here annexed (pp.
250, 251) are the principal ones of the earlier
half of the seventeenth century. The larger

in 1732. The upper of the two (p. 251) is reduced
from a large panoramic <i>South Prospect

<p>The earliest plan of New York of the period
which we are now considering is one which appeared
in the Rev. John Miller’s <i>Description of
the Province and City of New York, with the plans
of the City and several forts, as they existed in the
year 1695, now first printed from the original MS.</i>
(London, Rodd, 1843), and in a new ed., with
introd. and notes by Dr. Shea (N. Y., Gowans,
1862). See Vol. III. p. 420, of the present <i>History</i>,
and Mrs. Lamb’s <i>New York</i> (i. 421).</p>

<p>A fac-simile of this plan, marked “New York,
1695,” is annexed. It is reproduced several
times in Valentine’s <i>New York City Manual</i>
(1843-44, 1844-45, 1845-46, 1847, 1848, 1850,
1851, 1852), and is explained by the following:</p>

<p>There is a MS. plan of this date (1695) in the
British Museum. A plan of the fort in New
York (1695) is also given by Miller, and is reproduced
in Gowan’s ed. of Miller, p. 264. (Cf.

<p>The <i>Brit. Mus. Map Catal.</i> (1885), col. 2,972,

in 1720.</p>

<p>A large <i>Plan of the City of New York, from
an actual survey, made by Iames Lyne</i>, was published
by William Bradford, and dedicated to
Gov. Montgomerie, while Col. Robt. Lurting

in 1754, and was engraved by Jefferys, and reissued
in his <i>General Topog. of N. America</i>, etc., 1768, no. 29. It was reproduced
on the same scale in Philadelphia, in 1854. In 1857, through the instrumentality
of George M. Dallas, then minister to England, a large oil-painting, measuring
eight feet long and twenty inches high, was received by the Philadelphia library;
and attached to it was an inscription, <i>The southeast prospect of the City of Philadelphia,
by Peter Cooper, painter</i>, followed by a key to the public and private
buildings. Confidence in its literal fidelity is somewhat shaken by the undue
profusion of a sort of cupola given to buildings here and there,&mdash;one even surmounting
the Quaker meeting-house. Antiquaries are agreed that it must have
been painted about 1720. Among the private houses prominent in the picture
are that of Edward Shippen, at that time occupied by Sir William Keith, then
governor of the province, and that of Jonathan Dickinson. (Cf. <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i.
137.) It has been reëngraved on a small scale in Scharf and Westcott’s <i>Hist.
of Philadelphia</i>, vol. i., where will also be found (p. 187) a view of the old court-house,
from an ancient drawing (1710). Cf. view of 1744 in <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 207.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY JUSTIN WINSOR,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>The Editor</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">MARYLAND began its career as a crown province with conditions
similar to those which had regulated its growth under the Proprietary.
There was nothing within its limits worthy the name of a town,
though there were certain places where the courts met. The people were
planters, large and small. They, with their servants, were settled, each
with land enough about him, along the extensive tide-water front of the
Chesapeake and its estuaries. Each plantation had a wharf or landing of
its own, and no commercial centre was necessary to ship or receive merchandise.
The Indians were friendly, and no sense of mutual protection,
such as prevailed farther north, compelled the settlers to form communities.
They raised tobacco,&mdash;too much of it,&mdash;and saw hardly enough
of one another to foster a stable, political union. Local disturbances
were accordingly not very promptly suppressed. Because one was independent
in his living, he came to have too little sympathy with the independence
of the mass.</p>

<p>Life was easy. Land and water yielded abundantly of wild game, while
swine and cattle strayed about the woods, with ear-marks and brands to
designate their owners. The people, however, had mainly to pound their
corn and do without schools, for it needs villages to institute the convenient
mill-wheel and build the school-house. The condition of the people
had hardly changed from what it was during the seventeenth century.
When the eighteenth came in, a political change had already been wrought
by the revolution which placed William and Mary on the throne,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> for in
1692 the Marylanders had welcomed Sir Lionel Copley as the first royal
governor. In his train came a new spirit, or rather his coming engendered
one, or gave activity to one which had been latent. The assembly
soon ordained the Protestant Episcopal church to be the established
order of a colony which before had had a Catholic master. In time the
exclusiveness relaxed a little, enough in some fashion to exempt from
restraint those who were Protestant, but dissenters; but the Romanists
soon found to their cost that there was no relief for them. The fear of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Jacobite ascendency in the mother country easily kept the assembly alert
to discern the evils supposed to harbinger its advent.</p>

<p>Down to 1715 there was a succession of royal governors, but only one
among them made any impress upon the time. This was Francis Nicholson,
a man of vigor, who was felt during a long career in America in
more than one colony. He was by commission the lieutenant-governor
under Copley; but when that governor died, Nicholson was in England.
On returning he followed his predecessor’s way in studying the Protestants’
interests. In pursuance of this he made the Puritan settlement at Anne
Arundel, later to be known as Annapolis, the capital,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and left the old
Catholic St. Mary’s thereby to become a name and a ruin.</p>

<p>There grew up presently an unseemly quarrel between Nicholson and
Coode, a reprobate ecclesiastic, who had earlier been a conspicuous character
in Maryland history.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> The breach scandalized everybody; and
charge and counter-charge touching their respective morals contaminated
the atmosphere. Indeed, the indictment of Nicholson by his enemies
failed of effect by its excess of foulness. In face of all this the governor
had the merit, and even the courage, to found schools. He also acquired
with some a certain odor of sanctity, when he sent Bibles to the
sick during an epidemic, and appointed readers of them to attend upon a
sanitarium which had been established at a mineral spring in St. Mary’s
county. There was not a little need of piety somewhere, for the church
in Maryland as a rule had little of it. When Nicholson was in turn
transferred to Virginia, Nathaniel Blakiston (1699) and John Seymour
(1703) succeeded in the government. Under them there is little of moment
to note, beyond occasional inroads of the French by land and of
the pirates along the Chesapeake. Events, however, were shaping themselves
to put an end to the proprietary sway.</p>

<p>Charles, the third Lord Baltimore, died February 20, 1714-15, and
his title and rights descended to Benedict, his son, who had already in
anticipation renounced Catholicism. In becoming Protestant he had secured
from the Crown and its supporters an increased income in place
of the allowance that his Catholic father now denied him, out of the
revenues of the province, which were still preserved to the family. Benedict
had scarce been recognized when he also died (April 5, 1715), and his
minor son, Charles, the fifth lord, succeeded. The young baron’s guardian,
Lord Guilford, took the government, and finding to his liking John
Hart, who was then ruling the province for the king, he recommissioned
him as the representative of the Proprietary, who was now one in religious
profession with the vast majority of his people. The return of the old
master was to appearances a confirmation of the old charter; but an inevitable
change was impending.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the laws were revised and codified (1715), and a few years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
later (1722), by solemn resolution, the lower house of the assembly declared
that the people of Maryland were entitled to all the rights and immunities
of free Englishmen, and were of necessity inheritors of the common law
of England, except so far as the laws of the province limited the application
of that fundamental right.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> This manifesto was the signal of a conflict
between the ways that were and those that were to be. The Proprietary
and the upper house made a show of dissenting to its views; but
the old conditions were doomed. The methods of progress, however, for
a while were gentle, and on the whole the rule of succeeding governors,
Charles Calvert (1720), Benedict Leonard Calvert (1726), and Samuel Ogle
(1731), was quiet.</p>

<p>The press meanwhile was beginning to live, and the <i>Maryland Gazette</i>
was first published at Annapolis in 1727. A real town was founded,
though it seemed at the start to promise no more than St. Mary’s, Annapolis,
or Joppa.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> This was Baltimore, laid out in 1730, which grew so
leisurely that in twenty years it had scarce a hundred people in it. From
1732 to 1734 the Proprietary himself was in the province and governed in
his own person.</p>

<p>The almost interminable controversy with the Penns over the northern
bounds of Maryland still went on, the latter province getting the worst of
it. Even blood was shed when the Pennsylvania Germans, crossing the
line which Maryland claimed, refused to pay the Maryland taxes. During
this border turmoil, Thomas Cresap, a Maryland partisan, made head
against the Pennsylvanians, but was finally caught and carried to Philadelphia.
A truce came in the end, when, pending a decision in England, a
provisional line was run to separate settlers in actual possession.</p>

<p>Maryland had other troubles beside in a depreciated paper currency, and
was not singular in it. She sought in 1733 to find a remedy by making
tobacco a legal tender.</p>

<p>In 1751 the rights of the Proprietary again passed, this time to an
unworthy voluptuary, destined to be the last Baron Baltimore, Frederick,
the sixth in succession, who was not known to his people and did nothing
to establish a spirit of loyalty among them. They had now grown to be
not far from a hundred and thirty thousand in number, including multitudes
of redemptioners, as immigrants who had mortgaged their labor for their
ocean passage were called, and many thousands of transported convicts.
This population paid the Proprietary in quit-rents and dues not far from
seventy-five hundred pounds annually.</p>

<p>The beginning of the French war found Horatio Sharpe<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> fresh in office
(1753) as the representative of the man to whom the people paid this
money. There was need of resources to push the conflict, in which Maryland
had common interests with Virginia and Pennsylvania. The delegates
were willing to vote grants, provided the revenue of the Proprietary
would share in the burden. This the governor refused to consider; but as
the war went on, and the western settlements were abandoned before the
Indian forays, Sharpe conceded the point, and £40,000 were raised, partly
out of a double tax upon Catholics, who were in the main of the upper
classes of the people. The question of supplying the army lasted longer
than the £40,000, and each renewal of the controversy broadened the gulf
between the governor and the lower house. It soon grew to be observed
that the delegates planned their manœuvres with a view to overthrowing,
under the stress of the times, the government of the Proprietary. Occasionally
a fit of generosity would possess the delegates, as when they voted
£50 a scalp to some Cherokee rangers, and £1,500 to the Maryland contingent
in Forbes’s expedition against Du Quesne. It was never difficult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
meantime, for them to lapse into their policy of obstruction. So Maryland
did little to assist in the great conflict which drove the French from
North America.</p>

<p>When the war was practically closed, in 1760, the long dispute over the
boundary with Pennsylvania was brought to an end, substantially, upon the
agreement of 1732, by which the Proprietary of that day had been over-reached.
This fixed the limits of the present State of Delaware, and
marked the parallel which is now known as Mason and Dixon’s line. The
most powerful colony south of that line was Virginia, with whom Maryland
was also destined to have a protracted boundary dispute, that has extended
to our own time, and has been in part relegated to the consideration of the
new State, which the exigencies of the civil war caused to be detached
from the Old Dominion. What was and is the most westerly of the head
fountains of the Potomac (so the charter described the point from which
the meridian of Maryland’s western line should run) depended on seeking
that spot at the source of the northern or southern fork of the river. The
decision gave or lost to Maryland thirty or forty square miles of rich territory.
A temporary concession on Maryland’s part, which entailed such
a loss, became a precedent which she has found it difficult to dislodge.
Again, as the line followed down the Potomac, whether it gave the bed of
that river to Virginia or to Maryland, has produced further dispute, complicated
by diversities in the maps and by assumptions of rights, but in
1877 arbitration confirmed the bed to Maryland. Changing names and
shifting and disappearing soil along the banks of the Chesapeake have
also made an uncertainty of direction in the line, as it crosses the bay to
the eastern shore. A decision upon this point has in our day gained new
interest from the values which attach to the modern oyster-beds.</p>

<p class="p2">The history of Virginia was left in an earlier chapter<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> with the suppression
of Bacon’s Rebellion. The royal governors who succeeded Berkeley
held office under Lord Culpepper, who himself assumed the government in
1679,<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> bringing with him a general amnesty for the actors in the late rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
But pardon did not stop tobacco falling in price, nor was his lordship
chary of the state, to maintain which involved grinding taxes. Towns
would not grow where the people did not wish them, and even when the
assembly endeavored to compel such settlements to thrive at fixed landing
places, by what was called a Cohabitation Act (1680), they were not to be
evoked, and existed only as ghosts in what were called “paper towns.”
Tobacco, however, would grow if only planted, and when producers continued
to plant it beyond what the mob thought proper to maintain fit prices,
the wayward populace cut off the young plants, going about from plantation
to plantation.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Culpepper kept up another sort of destruction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
hanging the leaders of the mob, and in telling the people that a five-shilling
piece, if it went for six, would make money plentier. When the people
insisted that his salary should be paid in the same ratio, he revoked his
somewhat frantic monetary scheme.</p>

<p>When Culpepper ceased to be the Proprietary, in 1684, Virginia became
a royal province, and Charles II. sent out Lord Howard of Effingham to
continue the despotic rule. The new governor had instructions not to
allow a printing-press.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> He kept the hangman at his trade, for plant-cutting
still continued. The assembly managed to despatch Ludwell to England
to show how cruelly matters were going, and he got there just after
William and Mary were proclaimed. The representations against Effingham
sufficed to prevent the continuance of his personal rule, but not to put
an end to his commission, and he continued to draw his salary as governor,
despite his adherence to James, and after Francis Nicholson had been sent
over as his deputy (1690). The new ruler was not unskilled in governing;
but he had a temper that impelled him sometimes in wrong ways, and an
ambition that made the people distrust him. He could cajole and domineer
equally well, but he did not always choose the fit occasion. He was perhaps
wiser now than he was when he nearly precipitated New York into a
revolution; and he showed himself to the people as if to win their affections.
He encouraged manufactures. He moved the capital from Jamestown,
and created a small conspicuousness for Williamsburg<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> as he did for
Annapolis, in Maryland. He followed up the pirates if they appeared in the
bay. He tried to induce the burgesses to vote money to join the other colonies
in the French war; but they did not care so much for maintaining
frontier posts in order to protect the northern colonies as one might who
had hopes to be one day the general governor of the English colonies.
They intrigued in such a way that he lost popularity, when he had none too
much of it. He seemed generous, if we do not narrowly inspect his motives,
when he said he would pay the Virginia share of the war money, if the
assembly did not care to, and when he gave half of a gratuity which the assembly
had given him, to help found the college of William and Mary. This
last act had a look of magnanimity, for James Blair, who had been chiefly
instrumental in getting the college charter, and who also in a measure, as
the commissary of the Bishop of London, disputed Nicholson’s executive
supremacy, had laughed at his Excellency for his truculent ways. The
governor had opposed the “Cohabitation” policy as respects towns, and
a certain Burwell affair, in which as a lover he was not very complacent
in being worsted, had also made him enemies powerful enough to prefer
charges in England against him, and he was recalled,&mdash;later to be met in
New England and Acadia, and as Sir Francis Nicholson to govern in Carolina.</p>

<p>His service in Virginia was interrupted by his career in Maryland, ending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
in 1698, during which Sir Edmund Andros ruled in the larger colony.
This knight’s New England experience had told on him for the better;
but it had not wholly weaned him from some of his pettish ways. He
brought with him the charter of the College of William and Mary, and had
the infelicity to find in Blair, its first president, the adversary who was to
throw him. This Scotchman was combative and stubborn enough for his
race, and equally its representative in good sense and uprightness. Blair
insisted upon his prerogatives as the representative of the bishop, and taking
the grounds of quarrel with the governor to England he carried his
point, and Nicholson was recalled from Maryland to supply the place of
Andros.</p>

<p>The new college graduated its first class in 1700, and at about the same
time Claude Philippe de Richebourg and his Huguenots introduced a new
strain into the blood of Virginia.</p>

<p>The accession of Queen Anne led to the conferring of the titular governorship
in 1704 upon George Hamilton, the Earl of Orkney, who was to
hold the office nominally for forty years. For five years the council ruled
under Edward Jenings, their president, and when, December 15, 1704, he
made his proclamation of the victory of Blenheim, it was a satisfaction to
record that Colonel Parke, of Virginia, had been the officer sent by Marlborough
to convey the news to the queen.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>In 1710 the ablest of the royal governors came upon the scene, Alexander
Spotswood, a man now in his early prime, since he was born in 1676.
He bore a wound which he had got at this same Blenheim, for he had a decisive,
soldierly spirit. It was a new thing to have a governor for whom
the people could have any enthusiasm. He came with a peace-offering in
the shape of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, a boon the Virginians had been thus
far denied. The burgesses reciprocated in devoting £2,000 to build him
a palace, as it was called, as perhaps well they might, considering that their
annual tobacco crop was now about 20,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>The happy relations between the governor and his people did not continue
long without a rupture. The executive needed money to fortify the
frontiers, and the assembly tightened the purse-strings; but they did pass
a bill to appoint rangers to scour the country at the river heads.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Spotswood
did the best he could with scant funds. He managed to prevent the
tributary Indians from joining the Tuscaroras in their forays in Carolina,<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
and he induced the burgesses to take some action on the appeals of Governor
Pollock.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> He also gave his energy scope in developing the manufacture
of iron and the growing of vineyards, and in the stately march
which he made to find out something about the region beyond the Blue
Ridge.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> He was indeed always ready for any work which was required.</p>

<p>During Spotswood’s time, Virginia attained to as much political prominence
as the century saw for her prior to the Revolution. The German
element, which gathered away from tide-water,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> began to serve as a balance
to the Anglican aristocracy, which made the river banks so powerful. The
tobacco fields, while they in one sense made that aristocracy, in another
made them, in luckless seasons, slaves of a variable market. This relation,
producing financial servitude, enforced upon them at times almost the abjectness
of the African slaves whom they employed. Above it all, however,
arose a spirit of political freedom in contrast with their monetary
subjection. The burgesses gradually acquired more and more power, and
the finances of the province which they controlled gave them opportunities
which compensated for their personal cringing to the wilful imperialism
of the tobacco market. The people lacked, too, the independence
which mechanical ingenuity gives a race. A certain shiftlessness even
about the great estates, a laziness between crops, the content to import
the commonest articles instead of making them,&mdash;all indicate this. The
amenities of living which come from towns were wanting, with perhaps
some of the vices, for an ordinary or a public house generally stood even
yet for all that constituted a settlement of neighbors. In 1728 Byrd, of
Westover, speaks of Norfolk as having “most the air of a town of any in
Virginia.”</p>

<p>Spotswood remained in Virginia, and was a useful man after his fall from
office. He was made the deputy postmaster-general of the colonies (1730-39),
and he carried into the management of the mails the same energy
which had distinguished his earlier service, and brought Philadelphia and
Williamsburg within eight or ten days of each other. On his estates,
whether on the Rapidan near his Germans at Germanna, or in his house at
Yorktown, he kept the courtly state of his time and rank, and showed in
his household his tenderest side. His old martial spirit arose when he was
made a major-general to conduct an expedition to the West Indies; but he
died (1740) just as he was about to embark, bequeathing his books, maps,
and mathematical instruments to the College of William and Mary.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after a short service in the governor’s office by Hugh Drysdale
(1722)<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> and Robert Carter, in 1727 William Gooch took the chair, and
held it for twenty-two years. It was a time of only chance excitement, and
the province prospered in wealth and population. The governor proved
conciliatory and became a favorite of the people. He granted toleration to
the Presbyterians, who were now increasing on the frontiers, where Mackemie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and the Scotch-Irish were beginning to gain influence, and the sturdy
pioneers were thinking of the country beyond the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Some of
the tide-water spirit was pushing that way, and in 1745 Lord Fairfax settled
in the valley, built his Greenway Court, and passed his life in chasing
game and giving it to his guests, with other hospitable cheer.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Tall and
gaunt of person, sharp in his visage and defective in his eyesight, if he had
little of personal attraction for strangers, he had the inheritance of some
of the best culture of England, and could hand to his guests a volume of
the <i>Spectator</i>, open at his own essays. Disappointed in love at an early
day, Fairfax added a desire for seclusion to a disposition naturally eccentric.
He had come to America for divertisement, and, enamored of the
country and its easy life, he had finally determined on settling on his property.
The mansion, which he had intended to erect with all the dignity
of its manorial surroundings, was never begun; but he built a long one-story
building, with sloping roof and low eaves. Here he lived on through
the Revolution, a pronounced Tory, but too respected to be disturbed, until
the news of Yorktown almost literally struck him dead at ninety-two.</p>

<p>Along the river bottoms of the lowlands, while Major Mayo<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> was laying
out Richmond (1733), and while all tradition was scorned in the establishment
of the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> (1736),<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> the ruling classes of the great estates
felt that they were more rudely jostled than ever before, when Whitefield
passed that way, harrying the church,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> and even splitting the communions
of the Presbyterians as he journeyed in other parts.</p>

<p>When Governor Gooch returned to England, in 1749, he left the council
in power, who divided (1751) the province into four military districts, and
to the command of one of them they assigned a young man of nineteen,
George Washington by name. Late in the same year (November 20,
1751) a notable character presented himself in Robert Dinwiddie, and the
College of William and Mary welcomed the new executive with a formal
address.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Dinwiddie had been unpopular as a surveyor of customs, as
such officers almost invariably are; and he came to his new power in Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
at a trying time, just as a great war was opening, and he and the
burgesses could not escape conflict on the question of the money needed
to make Virginia bear a creditable part in that war. When it was the
northern frontiers towards Canada which were threatened, neither Maryland
nor Virginia could be made to feel the mortification that their governors
felt, if the northern colonies were left to fight alone the battles in
which all the English of the continent were interested.</p>

</div>

<p>But the struggle was now for the thither slope of the Alleghanies and the great water-shed
of the Ohio. In this conflict Virginia presented a frontier to be ravaged,
as she soon learned to her cost. The story of that misfortune is told in
another chapter,<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> as well as of the outbreak which Dinwiddie forced, when
he sent Washington to Le Bœuf. The exigencies of the conflict, however,
were not enough to prevent the assembly from watching jealously every
move of the governor for asking money from them; and he in turn did
little to smooth the way for their peaceable acquiescence, when he exacted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
unusual fees for his own emolument. The aristocracy were still powerful,
and, working upon the fears entertained by the masses that their liberties
were in danger, all classes contrived to keep Dinwiddie in a pretty constant
turmoil of mind, a strain that, though past sixty, he bore unflinchingly.
If, by his presentation of the exigencies, he alarmed them, they
would vote, somewhat scantily, the money which he asked for: but they
embarrassed him by placing its expenditure in the hands of their own committee.
Dinwiddie was often compelled to submit to their exasperating requirements,
and was obliged to inform the Lords of Trade that there was
no help for it.</p>

<p>It was war indeed, but this chapter is concerned chiefly with civil affairs.
Nothing, therefore, can be said here of the disaster of Braddock and its
train of events down to the final capture of DuQuesne. Forts were built,<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
and the Indians were pursued<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>, and Virginia incurred a debt during it all
of £400,000, which she had to bear with the concomitants of heavy taxes
and a depreciated paper money. At the end of the war, Norfolk, with its
7,000 inhabitants, was still the only considerable town.</p>

<p>Dinwiddie had ruled as the deputy of Lord Albemarle. When Lord
Loudon came over in July, 1756, to assume the military command in the
colonies, he became the titular governor of Virginia; but he was never in
his province in person, and Dinwiddie ruled for him till January, 1758,
when he sailed for England.</p>

<p>The one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of Baltimore, occurring in
1880, has produced several records. The city commemorated the event, and printed the
next year a <i>Memorial Volume, 1730-1880</i>, edited by Edward Spencer;<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> and the <i>Proceedings
of the Historical Society, October 12, 1880</i>, constitutes no. 16 of their Publication
Fund series. Mr. J. Thomas Scharf, who had published his <i>Chronicles of Baltimore</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
in 1874, elaborated the matter into the more extensive <i>History of Baltimore City
and County</i>, in 1881, published at Philadelphia. There is a plan of the city showing
its original and present bounds in this last book (p. 62), as well as in the same writer’s
<i>History of Maryland</i> (i. 416). In 1752 there was printed a <i>List of families and other
persons residing in Baltimore</i>, and this has been thought to be the earliest directory
of an American town. In the same year there was a view of Baltimore by John Moales,
engraved by Borgum, which is the earliest we have.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p>The coarse, hearty, and somewhat unappetizing life of the colony, as it appeared to
a London factor, who about the beginning of the eighteenth century sought the country
in quest of a cargo of tobacco, is set forth amusingly, as well as in a warning spirit, in
a rough Hudibrastic poem, <i>The Sot-weed Factor, by Eben Cook, Gent.</i><a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> (London, 1708.)</p>

<p>The literature of the controversy over the bounds of Maryland, so far as it relates to
the northern lines, has already been indicated in another volume.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> The dispute was ably
followed by McMahon in his <i>History of Maryland</i> (vol. i. pp. 18-59), among the earlier
of the general historians, and the whole question has been surveyed by Johnston in his
<i>History of Cecil County</i> (ch. xix.). He traces the course of the Cresap war,<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> the progress

running the line in accordance with the decision, being the record of John Watson, is
preserved in the library of the Pennsylvania Historical Society. Mr. Johnston (p. 307)
also describes the line of 1760,<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> and tells the story of the work and methods adopted
by Mason and Dixon in 1763, referring to their daily journal, one copy of which is, or
was, preserved in the Land Office, the other in the library of the Maryland Historical
Society.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> The scientific aspects of this famous survey are considered in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society</i> (1769); and a running sketch of the history
of the line, by William Darlington, is reprinted in the <i>Historical Magazine</i> (ii. p. 37).
Another, by T. Edwards, is in <i>Harper’s Monthly</i> (vol. liii. p. 549), and one by A. T.
McGill in the <i>Princeton Review</i> (vol. xxxvii. p. 88). Dunlap’s “Memoir” (see Vol. III.
p. 514) is also contained in <i>Olden Time</i> (vol. i. p. 529).</p>

<p>The most recent and one of the most careful surveys of the history of the dispute
between Baltimore and Penn and of the principles involved is in Walter B. Scaife’s
“Boundary Dispute between Maryland and Pennsylvania,” in <i>Pennsylvania Magazine
of History</i> (October, 1885, p. 241).</p>

<p>Chief among the maps bearing upon the question of the bounds are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A map of Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and East and West New Jersey, by
John Thornton</i>, which is without date, but probably from 1695 to 1700.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p><i>A new map of Virginia and Maryland and the improved parts of Pennsylvania and
New Jersey, revised by I. Senex, 1719.</i><a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p><i>A short account of the first settlement of the Provinces of Virginia, Maryland, New
York, and Pennsylvania by the English, to which is annexed a map of Maryland, according
to the bounds mentioned in the charter and also of the adjacent country, anno
1630</i>, London, 1735. This map is a large folding one called “A map of Virginia, according
to Capt. John Smith’s map, published anno 1606; also of the adjacent county, called
by the Dutch Niew Nederlant, anno 1630, by John Senex, 1735.”<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>The map accompanying the agreement of July 4, 1760, between Baltimore and Penn,
is reproduced, with the text of that document, in the <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, iv. (1853),
p.3.</p>

<p>Respecting the bounds in dispute between Maryland and Virginia, the fullest summary
of claims and evidence is in the <i>Report and Journal of Proceedings of the joint Commissioners
to adjust the boundary line of the States of Maryland and Virginia</i>, Annapolis,
1874. This volume gives statements of the Maryland (p. 63) and Virginia (p. 233)
claims, with depositions of witnesses. The volume as deposited in public libraries is
accompanied by a coast survey chart, in which the determined bounds are marked, with
the attestation of the governor of Maryland.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

<p>It may be collated with the <i>Report and accompanying documents of the Virginia Commissioners
on the boundary line between Maryland and Virginia</i>, Richmond, 1873, which
contains the statements of the Maryland Commissioners as well as those of the Virginia
Commissioners, the latter having a voluminous appendix of historical documents, including
a large number copied from the British Archives, and depositions taken in 1872. The
<i>Final Report of the Virginia Commissioners</i> (Richmond, 1874), includes a memorandum
of their journal and their correspondence (1870-72), as well as the journal of the joint
commissions of Virginia and Maryland (1872).</p>

Brandon, on James River. Byrd was b. 1674,

<p>Respecting the bounds of Virginia and North Carolina, commissioners on the part of
both colonies were appointed in 1710,<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> but the line was not run in its easterly portion
till 1728, by commissioners and surveyors of both governments. Col. William Byrd,
one of the commissioners of Virginia, prepared a sort of diary of the progress of the
work, which is known as a <i>History of the Dividing Line between Virginia and North
Carolina, as run in 1728-29</i>. This and other of Byrd’s writings which have come down
to us are in manuscript, in the hand of a copyist, but interlined and corrected by Byrd
himself. The volume containing them
was printed at Petersburg in 1841 (copyrighted
by Edmund Ruffin) with an anonymous
editor’s preface, which states that
the last owner of it was George E. Harrison,
of Brandon, and that the family had
probably been prevented from publishing
the papers because of the writer’s “great
freedom of expression and of censure,
often tinctured by his strong church
and state principles and prejudices;” for
Colonel Byrd was “a true and worthy
inheritor of the opinions and feelings of
the old cavaliers of Virginia.” These
papers were again privately printed at
Richmond, in 1866, under the editing of
Thomas H. Wynne, in two volumes, entitled
<i>History of the Dividing Line and
other tracts, from the papers of William
Byrd of Westover</i>. Mr. Wynne supplies
an historical introduction, and his text
is more faithful than that of 1841, since
some of the asperities of the manuscript were softened by the earlier editor. Byrd had
been particularly severe on the character of the North Carolinians, as he saw it in his
intercourse with them,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> and not the worst of his characterizations touched their “felicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of having nothing to do.” Byrd at the time of his commission was a man of four and
fifty, and he lived for some years longer, not dying till 1744. He was a good specimen of
the typical Virginian aristocrat, not blind to the faults of his neighbors, and the best
sample of such learning and wit as they had,<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> while he was not forgetful of some of the
duties to the community which a large estate imposed upon him. Among other efforts
to relieve the Virginians from their thraldom to a single staple were his attempts to
encourage the raising and manufacture of hemp.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> One of Byrd’s companions in the
boundary expedition of 1728-29 was the Rev. Peter Fontaine, who acted as chaplain to
the party, and a draft of the line as then marked is made in connection with some of
his letters in Ann Maury’s <i>Memoirs of a Huguenot Family</i> (New York, 1852, 1872, p.
356).<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> In 1749 the line was continued westerly beyond Peter’s Creek, by Joshua Fry
and Peter Jefferson, the father of Thomas Jefferson; and was still further continued to
the Tennessee River in 1778.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>Another question of bounds in Virginia, which it took some time to settle, was the
western limits of the northern neck, as the wedge-like tract of territory was called which
lay between the Rappahannock and the Potomac. It had been granted by Charles II. to
Lord Hopton and others, but when bought by Lord Thomas Culpepper a new royal
grant of it was made to him in 1688.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> It passed as a dower with Culpepper’s daughter
Catharine to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, and from him it passed to the sixth lord, Thomas,
who petitioned (1733) the king to have commissioners appointed to run the line between
the rivers. Of this commission was William Byrd, and an account of their proceedings
is given in the second volume of the <i>Byrd Manuscripts</i> (p. 83) as edited by Wynne. A
map of the tract was made at this time, which was called <i>The Courses of the Rivers Rappahannock
and Potowmack in Virginia, as surveyed according to order in the years 1736-1737</i>.
The bounds established by this commission were not confirmed by the king till
1745, and other commissioners were appointed the next year to run the line in question.
The original journal of the expedition for this purpose, kept by Maj. Thomas Lewis, is
now in the possession of John F. Lewis, lieutenant-governor of Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> The plate of
the map already referred to was corrected to conform, and this additional title to it was
added: <i>A Survey of the Northern Neck of Virginia, being the lands belonging to the Rt.
Honourable Thomas Lord Fairfax, Baron Cameron, bounded by and within the Bay of
Chesapoyocke, and between the Rivers Rappahannock and Potowmack</i>. Along the line
which is dotted to connect the head-spring of the southern branch of the Rappahannock
with the head-spring of the Potomac is a legend, noting that it was determined by the
king in council, April 11, 1745, that this line should be the westerly limit of the Fairfax
domain. A section of the second state of the plate of this map is annexed in fac-simile
from a copy in Harvard College library.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

records of Virginia.</p>

<p>The introduction to W. P. Palmer’s <i>Calendar of Virginia State Papers</i>, 1652-1781,
summarizes the documents for the period of our present survey which are contained in
the body of that book, and they largely concern the management of the Indians on the
borders.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> Among the Sparks MSS. in Harvard College library are various notes and
extracts respecting Maryland and Virginia from the English records (1727-1761) in the
hand of George Chalmers, as made for his own use in writing his <i>Revolt of the American
Colonies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p>There were various editions of the laws during the period now under consideration.
What is known as the Purvis collection, dedicated to Effingham, was published in London
in 1686; and a survey, giving <i>An abridgement of the Laws in force and use in her
majesty’s plantations</i>, including Virginia, was printed in London in 1704. The acts after
1662 were published in London in 1728; while the first Virginia imprint on any edition
was that of W. Parks, of Williamsburg, in 1733; and John Mercer’s <i>Abridgment</i>, published
in Williamsburg four years later (1737), was reprinted in Glasgow in 1759. The
acts since 1631 were again printed at Williamsburg in 1752.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>The earliest description of the country coming within the present survey is John Clayton’s
<i>Account of the several Observables in Virginia</i> (1688), which Force has included in
the third volume of his Tracts. A paper on the condition of Virginia in 1688 is the
first chapter in W. H. Foote’s <i>Sketches of Virginia</i> (1850). An “Account of the present
state and government of Virginia” is in the fifth volume (p. 124) of the <i>Massachusetts Hist.
Soc. Collections</i>. The document was presented to that society by Carter B. Harrison, of
Virginia. It seems to have been written in England in 1696-98, in the time of Andros’
governorship, and by one who was hostile to him and who had been in the colony.</p>

<p>Professor M. C. Tyler<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> speaks of the commissary, James Blair, as “the creator of
the healthiest and most extensive intellectual influence that was felt in the Southern
colonies before the Revolution.” This influence was chiefly felt in the fruition of
his efforts to found the College of William and Mary.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> <i>The Present State of Virginia
and the College, by Messieurs Hartwell, Blair and Chilton</i> (London, 1727), contains
an account, in which Blair, in Tyler’s opinion, had the chief hand. Blair’s relations
to the college have had special treatment in Foote’s <i>Sketches of Virginia</i> (ch. ix.); in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>

to the governor of Virginia, after the originals preserved

<p>While Francis Makemie was entering the lists in the interest of “cohabitation,” gaining
thereby not much respect from the tide-water great-estate owners, and printing in
London (1705) his <i>Plain and friendly perswasive to the inhabitants of Virginia and Maryland
for promoting towns and cohabitation</i>, setting forth the loss to virtue by the dispersal
of sympathizers in religion, Robert Beverley was publishing anonymously in London
(1705) his <i>History and Present State of Virginia, in four parts</i>. 1. <i>The History
of the First Settlement of Virginia, and the Government thereof, to the present time.</i>
2. <i>The Natural Productions and Conveniences of the Country, suited to Trade and Improvement.</i>

sets forth the condition of the colony at that time, offering some foundation for

<p>About twenty years later we have another exposition of the condition of the colony in
Hugh Jones’s <i>Present State of Virginia, giving a particular and strict account of the
Indian, English, and negro inhabitants of that colony</i>, published in London in 1724.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
Jones was rector of Jamestown and a professor in the college at Williamsburg, and his
book was a missionary enterprise to incite attention among the benevolent in the mother
country to the necessities of the colony. “His book,” says Tyler,<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> is one “of solid
facts and solid suggestions, written in a plain, positive style, just sufficiently tinctured
with the gentlemanly egotism of a Virginian and a churchman.”</p>

<p>The single staple of Virginia was the cause of constant concern, whether of good or
bad fortune, and the case was summed up in 1733,
in a tract published at London, <i>Case of the planters
of tobacco in Virginia, as represented by themselves,
with a vindication</i>.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Bringing the history of the colony
down to about the date of the period when Jones made his survey, Sir William
Keith in 1738 published his <i>History of the British Plantations in America, containing
the History of Virginia: with Remarks on the Trade and Commerce of that Colony</i>.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>
Nine years later (1747) Stith published his history, but it pertained only to the early

<p>When Burk published his <i>History of Virginia</i> in 1804,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> the days of the Revolution had
separated him from those that were in reality the formative period of the Virginian character,
which had grown out of conditions, then largely a mere record. One would have
expected to find the eighteenth century developed in Burk better than it is. The more
recent authorities have studied that period more specifically, though Bancroft does not
much enlarge upon it.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Lodge<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> is chiefly valuable for the conspectus he affords of the
manners of the time. Doyle in his <i>English in America</i> (London, 1882) depends on the
“Colonial Entry Books” and “Colonial Papers” of the State Paper Office in London.
Since Howison’s,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> the latest history is that by a Virginian novelist, John Esten Cooke,
and styled <i>Virginia, a history of the people</i> (Boston, 1883),<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> in which he aims to show,
through succeeding generations of Virginians, how the original characteristics of their
race have been woven into the texture of the population from the Chesapeake to the Mississippi,
as those of New England have controlled the north from the Atlantic to the
Lakes. He laments that there has never been a study of the Southern people to the same
extent as of the Northern, and says that some of the greatest events in the annals of
the whole country need, to understand them, a contemplation of the Virginian traits, losing
sight, as he expresses it, of “the fancied dignity of history.” Guided somewhat by
this canon, the author has modelled his narrative, dividing the periods into what he calls
the Plantation, the Colony, and the Commonwealth,&mdash;the second more than covering the
years now under consideration. He places first among his authorities for this period
<i>The Statutes at Large, being a Collection of all the Laws of Virginia</i>, by William Walter
Hening, in thirteen volumes, as the most important authority on social affairs in Virginia.
He speaks of its unattractive title failing to suggest the character of the work, and says,
with perhaps an excess of zeal, that “as a picture of colonial time, it has no rival in
American books.”</p>

<p>The institutional history of Virginia has of late received some particular attention at
the hands of Mr. Edward Ingle, who printed in the <i>Mag. of Amer. History</i> (Dec., 1884,
p. 532) a paper on “County Government in Virginia,” which he has reprinted with other
papers on the Land Tenure, the Hundreds, the English Parish in America, and the
Town, in a contribution called <i>Local Institutions of Virginia</i>, which makes parts ii. and

<p>We are fortunate in possessing the official correspondence of the two most notable
royal governors of the eighteenth century. The letters of Alexander Spotswood were
used by Bancroft, and were then lost sight of till they were recovered in England in
1873.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> They are now published in two volumes (Richmond, 1882, 1885) as <i>The official
letters of Alexander Spotswood, lieutenant-governor of Virginia, 1710-1722; now first
printed from the manuscript in the collections of the Virginia Historical Society, with
an introduction and notes by R. A. Brock</i>, constituting the initial volumes of a new
series of the <i>Collections</i> of the Virginia Historical Society. Spotswood’s official account
of his conflict with the burgesses is printed in the <i>Virginia Hist. Register</i>; and we
best see him as a man in William Byrd’s “Progress to the Mines,” included in Wynne’s
edition of the <i>Byrd Manuscripts</i>. Palmer draws Spotswood’s character in the introduction
to his <i>Calendar of Virginia State Papers</i>, p. xxxix.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

of Virginia, 1751-1758; now first printed from the manuscript in the collections
of the Virginia Historical Society, with an introduction and notes by R. A. Brock</i>,

<p>The valley of Virginia has been more written about locally than the eastern parts.
Beside the old history of Kercheval,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> W. H. Foote has embraced it in the second series
of his <i>Sketches of Virginia</i> (Philad., 1855), and it has recently been treated in J. Lewis
Peyton’s <i>History of Augusta County, Va.</i> (Staunton, Va., 1882), a region once embracing
the territory from the Blue Ridge to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Norfolk has been made the subject of historical study, as in W. S. Forrest’s <i>Norfolk
and Vicinity</i> (1853), but with scant attention to the period back of its rise to commercial
importance.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical element forms a large part of Virginia history in the earlier times.
Some general references have been given in another place.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> At the opening of our present

churches and chapels and thirty ministers,&mdash;according to Bray’s <i>Apostolic Charity</i>
(London, 1700).<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> The church history has been well studied by Dr. Hawks,<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> Bishop Perry,<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
and Dr. De Costa,<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> in this country, and by Anderson in his <i>History of the Colonial
Church</i> (1856),&mdash;a book which Doyle calls “laborious and trustworthy on every page.”
Bishop Meade has treated the subject locally in his <i>Old Churches and Families of Virginia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
as has Dr. Philip Slaughter in his <i>Saint George’s Parish</i>, <i>Saint Mark’s Parish</i>
and <i>Bristol Parish</i>,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> and he has given a summary of the leading churches of colonial Virginia
in a section of Bishop Perry’s <i>Amer. Episc. Church</i> (vol. i. p. 614).</p>

<p>The dissenting element was chiefly among the Presbyterians, whose later strongholds
were away from the tide-water among the mountains. The Reverend Francis Mackemie<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>
had been principal leader among them, and he was the first dissenter who had leave to
preach in Virginia. Their story is best told in C. A. Briggs’ <i>American Presbyterianism</i>
(p. 109), and in both series of W. H. Foote’s <i>Sketches of Virginia</i> (Phil., 1850, 1855).</p>

<p>The Baptists in Virginia did not attain numerical importance till within the decade preceding
the American Revolution, and they had effected scarcely any influence among the
opponents of establishment during the period now under consideration.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> The Huguenots

<p>In depicting the society of Virginia during this period, we must get what glimpses we
can from not very promising sources. The spirit which despised literature and schools
was in the end dispelled, in part at least, but it was at this time dominant enough to prevent
the writing of books; and consequently the light thrown upon social life by literature
is wanting almost entirely. The Virginians were apparently not letter-writers and diarists,
as the New Englanders were, and while we have a wealth of correspondence in
Massachusetts to help us comprehend the habits of living, we find little or nothing in
Virginia. We meet, indeed, with some letters of the Byrds<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> and the Fontaines,<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> and the
official correspondence of Spotswood and Dinwiddie; but the latter touch only in a casual
way upon the habits of living. A few descriptive and political tracts, like Hugh Jones’
<i>Present State</i>,<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> give us small glimpses. Later Virginia writers like Bishop Meade<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> and
Dr. Philip Slaughter,<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> have gathered up whatever of tradition has floated down in family
gossip; and Foote<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> and Esten Cooke<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> have drawn the picture from what sources they
could command, as Irving has in his <i>Life of Washington</i>.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> The most elaborate survey
of the subject, with philosophic impulses, has been made by Eben Greenough Scott in his
<i>Development of Constitutional Liberty in the English Colonies of America</i> (New York,
1882),<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> in which he contrasts the manners of the lowland aristocracy with those of the
farmers of the valley and with the wilder life of the frontiers.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> The most elaborate composite
of data derived from every source is the chapter on “Virginia in 1765,” in Henry
Cabot Lodge’s <i>Short History of the English Colonies</i>, in which he depends very largely
on the survival of manners in the days when Burnaby, Anburey, Robin, Smyth, Brissot
de Warville, Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, and Weld travelled in the country,&mdash;material
which has the great disadvantage of being derived from chance observation, with more
or less of generalization based on insufficient instances, as Dr. Dwight has pointed out
in the case of Weld at least.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE CAROLINAS.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY PROFESSOR WILLIAM J. RIVERS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">NORTH CAROLINA: <span class="smcap">Proprietary Government</span>.&mdash;It was certainly
manifest to England that her claim to vast regions of valuable
territory would be substantiated, and her commerce and political
power augmented, by the settling of her subjects in North America.
Yet the history of her colonies bears, on many pages, evidence of the
indifference and inexcusable neglect of the mother country. Instead of a
liberal contribution of arms and
munitions of war, the means of
sustenance, and the protection
of her ever-present sovereignty
to all who were willing to
leave the comforts of home and
risk their lives in her service,
far away across the Atlantic,
enough appeared to have been
done if lavish gifts of land were
bestowed upon companies, individuals,
or proprietors, for their
especial emolument, and through
them some paltry acres offered
to emigrants, with promises of
a little more religious freedom
and a little larger share of political
privileges than they were permitted to enjoy at home. The genesis
of a new and potent nationality may be said to have been involved in
the acceptance, by the colonists, of these conditions, as inducements to
emigration, with all else dependent on their own manly courage.</p>

<p>One of the colonies that struggled, through neglect and almost insurmountable
hardships, into permanent existence was Carolina. Before its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
settlement, other colonies had successfully established themselves in New
England, and in Maryland and Virginia. In 1663, Charles II., in the
second year after his restoration, granted the region south of Virginia
and extending from 31° to 36° north latitude, and westward within these
parallels across the continent, to some of his adherents, to whom he was
indebted for distinguished services. It is stated in the grant that this
extensive region is called “Carolina,” a name used before, and now, no
doubt, retained in honor of the king.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> The favored noblemen are thus
introduced to us: “our right trusty and right well-beloved cousins and
counsellors, Edward, Earl of Clarendon, our High Chancellor of England,
and George, Duke of Albemarle, Master of our Horse and Captain-General
of all our Forces, our right trusty and well-beloved William Lord Craven,
John Lord Berkeley, our right trusty and well-beloved counsellor, Anthony
Lord Ashley, Chancellor of our Exchequer, Sir George Carteret,
Knight and Baronet, Vice-Chamberlain of our Household, and our trusty
and well-beloved Sir William Berkeley, Knight, and Sir John Colleton,
Knight and Baronet;” who, we are deliberately informed, “being excited
with a laudable and pious zeal for the propagation of the Christian faith,
and the enlargement of” the British dominions, humbly besought leave
of the king, “by their industry and charge, to transport and make an
ample colony” of his subjects, “in the parts of America not yet cultivated
or planted, and only inhabited by some barbarous people who have
no knowledge of Almighty God.”<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> Had these high functionaries of the
realm acted in accordance with this solemn announcement of their pious
zeal for the propagation of Christianity, the blessing of Heaven would,
no doubt, have rested more largely upon their noble enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>An adverse claim was soon made to the same territory under a grant
obtained in 1629,<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> by Sir Robert Heath, attorney-general of Charles I.
But he had failed to form a colony, and the claims of those to whom he
had conveyed his rights were on that account set aside. The Proprietors
under the new charter began to make immediate exertions to form a settlement,
that the king might see they did not “sleep with his grant, but
were promoting his service and his subjects’ profit.”<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>Before this, settlers from Virginia had moved at various times southward
and taken up their residence on some good lands on and near the
river Chowan, in what is now the northeastern part of North Carolina.
Among these was a considerable number of Quakers, at that time subject
to religious persecution. It happened that Sir William Berkeley, one of
the new Proprietors, was governor of Virginia. He was empowered by
the other Proprietors to form a government forthwith in this settlement,
and appoint its officers; the appointment of surveyor and secretary alone
being reserved to the Proprietors in England. “We do likewise send
you proposals to all that will plant, which we prepared upon receipt of a
paper from persons that desired to settle near Cape Fear, in which our
considerations are as low as it is possible for us to descend. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
not intended for your meridian, where we hope to find more facile people,
who, by your interest, may settle upon better terms for us, which we leave
to your management, with our opinion that you grant as much as is possible
rather than deter any from planting there.” Sir William, it is inferred,
followed these instructions. William Drummond was appointed
governor;<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> the tract of land, at first forty miles square, was named Albemarle
in honor of the duke, and a council of six was constituted to
make laws with the consent of the delegates of the freemen. These laws
were to be transmitted to England for approval by the Proprietors. Lands
were granted to all free of rent for three years; and such lands as had
been taken by previous settlers were confirmed to them.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously another colony (Clarendon) was settled in what
is now North Carolina. As early as 1660 some adventurers from Massachusetts
had gone to the Cape Fear, sometimes called the Charles, River,
and purchased lands from the Indians; but in a few years abandoned the
situation, leaving their cattle and swine in care of the natives. To the
same locality the attention of the inhabitants of Barbadoes<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> was directed
on the grant of the territory to the powerful noblemen whose names are
given in the charter. The passage already quoted from the letter to Sir
William Berkeley had reference to them and their proposal. Explorers,
employed by “several gentlemen and merchants” of Barbadoes, were sent
out (1663) under command of Hilton, who ascended the Cape Fear far
inland, and formed a more favorable opinion of the country than the New
Englanders had been enabled to form near the mouth of the river. They
purchased from the Indians “the river and land of Cape Fair,” as they
express it, and returned to Barbadoes on January 6, 1664. An account of
their exploration was published the same year, to which were appended
proposals from the Proprietors, through their commissioners, Thomas
Mudyford and Peter Colleton, to all who should settle, at their own hazard
and expense, south and west of Cape Romano, sometimes called Cape
Carteret. This was a bid for volunteer settlers south of the Cape Fear
settlement. Nothing whatever, it appears, was accomplished under this
offer of the commissioners. In a <i>Description of the Province</i>, with liberal
privileges offered to settlers, issued also in London (1666), it is stated
that a new plantation had been begun by the English at Cape Fear on
the 29th of May, 1664. In the following November, Robert Sandford was
appointed secretary and John Vassall surveyor of “Clarendon County.”<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
It was time the Proprietors should agree upon some definite and satisfactory
terms for settlement in their territory. While they did not sanction
the purchase of lands from Indians, as they had also disallowed the claims
of the New England adventurers, they made to all colonists, from Barbadoes
and elsewhere, liberal offers for settlement; and under “concessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and agreement” a method of government was framed, and John Yeamans
of Barbadoes was knighted by the king (through means of Sir John Colleton),
and commissioned, in January, 1665, governor of the newly formed
Clarendon County<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> and of the territory southward as far as Florida; for
in this direction the Proprietors designed to place a third colony or county.</p>

<p>The two counties, Albemarle and Clarendon, were formed under the
charter of 1663. Another charter was granted by the good-natured king
in June, 1665, enlarging the limits of the province to 36° 30´ on the north,
and on the south to 29°. This extension may be ascribed to the desire of
the Proprietors to secure beyond doubt the section on which the Chowan
colony happened to be formed near Virginia, and to embrace, southwardly,
the limits claimed with respect to Spanish Florida.</p>

<p>We have very little knowledge concerning the administrations of Drummond
and of Yeamans. It is said that the latter, being near the sea, began
at once to export lumber and opened a trade with Barbadoes; and reports
so favorable were carried thither, and so many were induced to follow the
first emigrants, that the authorities of the island interposed, and forbade,
under severe penalties, “the spiriting off” of their people. In Albemarle,
Drummond was succeeded by Samuel Stephens as governor in 1667. In
Clarendon, the colony soon ceased to prosper, and most, if not all, of the colonists
had abandoned it in 1667. We shall understand better why they did
so if we bear in mind that the territory of the Lords Proprietors was very
extensive. There were other places, not yet explored, more convenient for
commerce, more defensible, more fruitful, more desirable in all respects;
the advantages of which would naturally draw off settlers from the less
favorable localities selected before a thorough knowledge of the country
was obtained. The Proprietors, as we have said, thought of forming, with
larger preparations, a colony still further south. The famous harbor of
Port Royal, in what is now South Carolina, was the locality they desired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
occupy and (with unusual display of wisdom) to fortify. For reasons, however,
which will appear hereafter, when we treat of South Carolina, the colonists,
after visiting Port Royal, and after a temporary settlement at Albemarle
Point on the western bank of the Ashley River, finally settled down
on the opposite side, at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper rivers,
and founded the present city of Charleston. There was, indeed, enough to
discourage the settlers at Cape Fear independently of the more extensive
preparation by the Proprietors to place a colony in a better situation. Secretary
Sandford (in his <i>Relation</i> of his voyage in 1666) incidentally mentions:
“Wee were in actuall warre with the natives att Clarendon, and had
killed and sent away many of them, for they [the more southern Indians]
frequently discoursed with us concerning the warre, told us the natives
were noughts, their land sandy and barren, their country sickly.” Surveyor-General
Vassall, in a letter from Virginia (Oct. 6, 1667), speaks of
the loss of the plantation on Charles River and his furnishing shipping to
carry away “such weak persons as were not able to go by land.” And a
letter from Boston (Dec. 16, 1667) states that Cape Fear was deserted,
and the settlers “come hither, some to Virginia.”<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>Here let us notice the policy and plans of the Proprietors with respect
to their distant colonies. The two charters differ only in a few particulars.
The second increases the extent of territory, its main object, gives
power to subdivide the province into distinct governments, and is a little
more explicit with regard to religious toleration. No person was to be molested
for difference of religious opinion or practice who did not actually
disturb the peace of the community. With regard to political privileges,
there is an important clause in both charters conferring upon the Proprietors
power to ordain any laws and constitutions whatsoever (if consonant
to reason and, as far as possible, to the laws and customs of England), but
only “by and with the advice, assent, and approbation of the freemen,” or
the majority of them, or of their delegates or deputies, who, for enacting
such ordinances, were to be duly assembled from time to time. These
privileges, we shall see in the history of the colony, were maintained by
the people with a pertinacity commensurate with their importance, whenever
their lordships attempted to control the colonists without due regard
to their approbation and consent. The charter reserved to the king only
allegiance and sovereignty; in all other respects the Proprietors were absolute
lords, with no other service or duty to their monarch than the annual
payment of a trifling sum of money, and in case gold or silver should be
found a fourth part thereof.</p>

<p>On August 6, 1663, a letter to the Proprietors, from members of a
Cape Fear company of New England adventurers, claimed full liberty to
choose their governors, make and confirm laws, and to be free from taxes,
except such as they might impose on themselves, and deprecated “discouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in reference to their government” as to the accustomed privileges
of English colonists. While their claims were not conceded, this letter
was answered generally by their lordships, on August 25th, announcing
their concessions to all wishing to settle in Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> The New England
claim of privileges is worthy of notice for what we now call “advanced
ideas.” And if we compare the charters of Connecticut (1662) and Rhode
Island (1663) with that of Carolina (1663), it will appear that the self-interest
of Clarendon<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> and his associates stood in the way of their securing to
their colony some civil privileges which it would not have seemed strange
at that time to concede. And it may as well be stated here, at once, that
besides considerations of self-interest it was also the express policy of their
lordships to “avoid erecting a numerous democracy” in their province. To
carry out this policy, a grand scheme of government, called the Fundamental
Constitutions, was framed by Shaftesbury and the philosopher
Locke, and solemnly confirmed as a compact among themselves,&mdash;the Proprietors,&mdash;and
which was to be unalterable forever. A scheme more utopian,
more unsuited to the actual condition of the colonists, could hardly
have been devised. Yet its adoption by the people was recommended,
ordered, stubbornly insisted on by their lordships at the risk of balking&mdash;as,
for a while, it did balk&mdash;the prosperity of their colony. The first set
of the unalterable Constitutions is dated 21st July, 1669; the second was
issued in March, 1670,&mdash;and so on till a fifth set had been constructed.
Under the right conferred by the charter, respecting the consent of the
freemen, or their delegates, in establishing laws and constitutions, such
consent was never formally given; and the code was, at least in South Carolina,
again and again rejected. It was a gage of political contention foolishly
thrown down; but in taking it up, the colonists were made ardent
students of political rights.</p>

<p>By these Constitutions, the eldest Proprietor was made Palatine,&mdash;a sort
of king of the province. The other seven Proprietors were to be high
functionaries: admiral, chamberlain, constable, chief justice, chancellor, high
steward, and treasurer.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> There was to be a Parliament: eight superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
courts, one to each Proprietor according to his high office; county and
precinct courts; and a grand Executive Council, among whose duties was
the preparation and first enactment of all matters to be submitted to Parliament.
Among the carefully composed articles in these Constitutions
should be noticed such as enjoin that no person above seventeen years of
age could have the benefit and protection of the law who was not a member
of some church; and no one could hold an estate or become a freeman of the
province, or have any habitation in it, who did not acknowledge a God and
that He is publicly and solemnly to be worshipped. Moreover, in the set
of the Constitutions printed and sent over for adoption, the Church of England<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>
was made the established church, and “it alone shall be allowed to
receive a public maintenance by grant of Parliament.” It was also enjoined
that no one seventeen years old should have any estate or possession
or the protection of the law in the province, unless he subscribed the
Fundamental Constitutions and promised in writing to defend and maintain
them to the utmost of his power.</p>

<p>Their lordships in England, and most, if not all, of their appointed officers
in the colonies, as in duty bound, contended strenuously for the adoption
of this preposterous form of government till the year 1698; and hardly
then did the incontrovertible logic of events convince them of their folly.
A late historian of North Carolina remarks, “Their lordships theorized,
the colonists felt; the Proprietors drew pictures, but the hardy woodsmen
of Carolina were grappling with stern realities. Titles of nobility, orders
of precedence, the shows of an empty pageantry, were to them but toys
which might amuse children; but there was no romance in watching the
savage, or felling the forest, or planting the corn, or gathering the crop,
with the ever-present weapon in reach of the laboring hand.”</p>

<p>There was another cause of irritation on the part of the colonists, both
in North and South Carolina. The terms of the tenure of land were of
paramount interest to them and their children. The quantity offered in
1663 was augmented in 1666, and two years later, by the “Great Deed
of Grant,” the fear of forfeiture was removed for not clearing and planting
a specified portion of the land; in other words, settlers were permitted
to hold lands as they were held in the adjoining royal province
of Virginia. At first each freeman received one hundred acres, the same
for his wife, each child and manservant, and fifty for each woman-servant;
paying a half-penny per acre. After the expiration of servitude, each servant
received a liberal quantity of land with implements for tillage.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> In
1669, in the settling of the colony at Ashley River, one hundred and fifty
acres were offered to all free persons above sixteen years of age, and the
same for able-bodied men-servants; and a proportionate increase for others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
if they arrived before the 25th of March, 1670; then a less number of
acres for subsequent arrivals. The annual rent was a penny or <i>the value
of a penny</i> per acre (as also announced in the unalterable Constitutions);
payments to begin September, 1689.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> When Governor Sayle died (a year
after settling on Ashley River), Sir John Yeamans came from Barbadoes
to the new settlement; and having been made a landgrave claimed the
government as vice-palatine under the Fundamental Constitutions. Such
claim was denied by the colonists;<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> but he soon received a commission,
and his first measure, on assuming control, was to have an accurate survey
made and a record of lands held by settlers in South Carolina, with a view
to the collection of quit-rents for the Proprietors. When ten years of
outlay for their province had brought them no pecuniary return, they began
to think “the country was not worth having at that rate.” They
removed their former favorite Yeamans, because further outlays were incurred,
and placed West in authority, who had attended more successfully
to their interests. In November, 1682, all prior terms for granting land
were annulled, and if a penny an acre (the words “or the value of a
penny” being omitted) was not paid, a right of reëntry was claimed: “to
enter and distraine, and the distress or distresses then and there found
to take, lead, and carry and drive away and impound, and to detain and
keep until they shall be fully satisfied and paid all arrears of the said
rent.” This produced inequality of tenure, or operated to the injury of
many who had previously taken up, on more liberal terms, only part of
the lands they were entitled to.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Their lordships were too just to interfere
with the stability of titles, but the alteration of the tenure for new
grants or of the mode of conveyance, from time to time, was at least
unwise. Besides, there was scarcely any coin in the province, and the
people found it hard that they could no longer pay in merchantable produce.
To their reasonable request for relief and a better encouragement
to new settlers came the reply, “We insist to sell our lands our own way.”
With this reply a peremptory order was sent that the third set of the
unalterable Constitutions should be put in force.</p>

<p>A part of this manifest diminution of the generosity of the Proprietors
and their unwillingness to bestow further concessions may be accounted
for by the opposition their favorite scheme of government had encountered
in both colonies, and especially by a rebellious outbreak which had
just occurred in Albemarle County. Clarendon County at Cape Fear had
broken up and disappeared, as we have related; and henceforth our attention
must be directed to Albemarle at the northern end of the province
and the Ashley River colony at the south, remote from each other, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
vast forest intervening, the dwelling place of numerous tribes of Indians.
Before the province was authoritatively divided (1729), it had divided itself,
as it were, into North and South Carolina; and it is best that, in this
narrative, we should begin to call them so.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, the Quakers, who were in close association and
unison, and so far influential in action,<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> opposed the Fundamental Constitutions
and the Church of England establishment; and all the settlers
looked upon the enforcement of the recent orders of the Proprietors&mdash;the
displacement of an easy and liberal method of government without
asking their assent&mdash;as a violation of the terms of settlement, and of the
inducements at first held out to them.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Governor Stephens endeavored
to enforce the orders of the Proprietors, but he died soon after receiving
them, and was succeeded by Carteret, president of the council, till an
appointment should be made. Carteret appears not to have been of a
nature to contend against the disaffection and turbulence which had arisen,
and, in 1675, went to England to make known personally, it is said, the
distracted condition of the colony. But two of the colonists, Eastchurch
and Miller, had also gone over to represent, personally, the grievances of
the people. They seemed, to the Proprietors, the ablest men to carry out
their instructions; and the former was made governor and the latter
deputy of Earl Shaftesbury and secretary of the province; he was also
made, by the commissioners of the king’s revenue, collector of such
revenue in Albemarle. They sailed for Carolina in 1677, but the new
governor remained a long while in the West Indies (winning “a lady and
her fortune”), and died soon after reaching Albemarle. Miller as representing
Eastchurch, but really without legal authority to act as governor,
ruled with a high hand. He had gone to represent the grievances of
his fellow colonists; he returned to harass them still more. The new
“model” of government, the denial of “a free election of an assembly”
(as the Pasquotank people complained), the attempt to enforce strictly the
navigation laws, the collection of the tax on tobacco at their very doors,<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
his drunkenness and “putting the people in general by his threats and
actions in great dread of their lives and estates,” as the Proprietors themselves
express it, became intolerable to the colonists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>The New Englanders, with their characteristic enterprise, had long
been sailing through the shallow waters of the Sound in coasting vessels,
adapted to such navigation, and had largely monopolized the trade of
North Carolina; buying or trafficking for lumber and cattle, which they
sold in the West Indies, and bringing back rum, molasses, salt, and sugar,
they exchanged these for tobacco, which they carried to Massachusetts,
and shipped thence to Europe without much regard to the navigation
laws. Miller, according to instructions sent to Governor Eastchurch,
sought to break up this thriving and lucrative business, and to introduce
a more direct trade with England. The populace generally, including
the Quakers, had their own grievances, and fraternized with the New
England skippers. Gillam, one of these bold captains, arrived with his
vessel laden with the commodities the people needed, and armed, this
time, with cannon. A wealthy Quaker, Durant, was on board with him.
On land, John Culpepper, who had lately left South Carolina, where he
had created commotions, became a leader of the malcontents. Influenced,
no doubt, by the recent rebellion of Bacon in Virginia, some participators
in which had taken refuge among them, and led on by men
of courage whose hard-earned emoluments were threatened with ruin, the
insurgents seized and imprisoned Miller and seven of the proprietary deputies,
and took from the former a large amount of money which he had
collected for the king. They had won over to their side the remaining
deputy, the president of the council; and together they now governed
the colony as seemed best to them. But they were aware that violence
and usurpation could not be passed over with impunity by higher authority;
and as Miller and some of his adherents had escaped and gone to
England, Culpepper and Holden were also sent to the Proprietors on a
mission of explanation. The explanation of neither party was entirely
satisfactory. Miller lost his offices, and Culpepper, though he was unpunished
by the Proprietors, was seized by the Commissioners of the
Customs to answer for the revenue money which had been used in the
time of the disorders. He was put on trial, in 1680, for “treason committed
without the realm.” It is said by Chalmers that the judges ruled
that taking up arms against the proprietary government was treason
against the king. Notwithstanding this view of the case, Culpepper was
acquitted of treason, because Shaftesbury asserted that the county of Albemarle
had not a regular government, and the offence of the prisoner
amounted to no more than a riot.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>At this time the Earl of Clarendon sold his proprietary share to Seth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Sothel, who was appointed governor. Mr. John Harvey, as president of
the council at Albemarle, was to exercise the functions of governor till
Sothel’s arrival. The latter, on his voyage, was captured by an Algerine
corsair; Harvey died; Jenkins was made governor, and was deposed by
the people without reprimand from the Proprietors; and in February,
1681, Wilkinson was appointed. These sudden changes in executive authority
were unfortunate for the prestige of proprietary power in the colony;
for all this while and until Sothel came in 1683, the old adherents
of the Culpepper party, or the popular party, held control in Albemarle.
But still more unfortunate for the Proprietors was the coming of Sothel.
He seems to have purchased his place as Proprietor and to have come as
governor in order to have a clear field for the exercise of his rapacity.
If he was “a sober, moderate man,” as his colleagues thought when they
intrusted their interests and the welfare of the county to his hands, his
association with the Algerines must have materially changed his character.
In 1688, the outraged colonists seized him, intending to send him to England
for trial. On his appeal this was not done, but the case referred
to the colonial assembly, who condemned him. His sentence, however,
amounted only to banishment for twelve months and perpetual deposition
from authority, Proprietor though he was. He went to South Carolina,
and his further career will be noticed when we review the history of that
colony.</p>

<p>The next year Philip Ludwell, of Virginia, was made governor, and
after four years was transferred to South Carolina and appointed governor
of both colonies. For more than twenty years North Carolina was governed
by a deputy of the governor at Charleston, or (when there was no deputy
appointed) by the president of her own council. The Albemarle colony
had become to the Proprietors only a source of vexation. At any rate,
they acted wisely in leaving its management, in some measure, under the
control of those more conversant with its affairs than their lordships in
England could possibly be. Their own mismanagement, in truth, was the
principal cause of the turbulent spirit of the people.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>After Sothel’s banishment the executive authority belonged, as a rule, to
the president of the council till Ludwell received it in 1689. On the latter’s
removal to Charleston, S. C., Lillington acted as deputy in Albemarle.
In 1695, Thomas Harvey became deputy governor by appointment from
Archdale, the Quaker Proprietor (who was sent over to heal grievances in
both colonies), and was followed in 1699 by Henderson Walker, president
of the council. In 1704, Robert Daniel was appointed deputy by Governor
Johnson, of South Carolina. John Porter, a Quaker, or sympathizer
with the Quakers (sent to England to complain of Daniel and legislation in
favor of the Church of England in the colony by “The Vestry Act”), with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the assistance of Archdale, prevailed on the Proprietors to order Daniel’s
removal, and Governor Johnson appointed (1705) Thomas Carey in his
place. He was as little acceptable to the Quakers in North Carolina as
his predecessor had been, and through their influence in England at this
conjuncture the appointment of a deputy by the executive in South Carolina
was suspended, Carey was removed, and a new Proprietary Council
formed, including Porter and several Quakers. Porter returned to North
Carolina in 1707, and called together the new council, who chose William
Glover, a Churchman, president, and, as such, acting governor. He, however,
as Carey had done, required conformity to the English laws respecting
official oaths, which were displeasing to the Quakers; and Porter
in opposition declared Glover’s election as president illegal, formed a coalition
with Carey, whom he had before caused to be displaced, and secured
his election to the presidency of the council. There were now two claimants
for executive authority, and no power at hand to decide between
them. Carey and Glover sat in opposite rooms with their respective councils.
Daniel, being a landgrave, and having thereby a right to a seat in
the Upper House,&mdash;as the council with the governor was styled,&mdash;sat
alternately with one and the other, and no doubt enjoyed their altercations.</p>

<p>A new rebellion, so-called, now broke out, based apparently on local
party strife. At first Carey and his Quaker supporters opposing Glover
and his party sought and obtained control of the assembly; and when
Edward Hyde came from England with letters on authority of which he
claimed executive power,<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> the Carey party, at first favorable to him, finally,
on losing control of the next assembly, directed itself against him. Hyde’s
life was endangered by Carey’s armed opposition; and Spotswood, the
energetic governor of Virginia, sent him military aid and put down his
opponents.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Carey, on his way through Virginia, was arrested by Spotswood
and sent to England for trial. This was the occasion of Lord Dartmouth’s
circular letter to all the colonies “to send over no more prisoners
for crimes or misdemeanors without proof of their guilt.”</p>

<p>According to the latest history,&mdash;that of Rev. Dr. Hawks,&mdash;another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
result of this acrimonious contest was the deplorable massacre of hundreds
of defenceless white settlers, men, women, and children, by the Tuscarora
Indians. This is doubtless merely <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i>. We must
ascribe hostilities solely to encroachments on the lands of the natives;
to ill treatment by traders and others; and to the killing of one of their
number, which called for revenge. The Tuscaroras, it was thought, could
muster 1,200 warriors. They suddenly made their onslaught at daybreak,
September 22, 1711. Their special task in the diabolical conspiracy was
to murder all the whites along the Roanoke, while other tribes conducted
a simultaneous attack upon other sections. The wielding of the blood-dripping
knife and tomahawk, the conflagration of dwellings and barns,
the murderous rush upon the victims who, here and there, had hidden
themselves and who ran out from the blazing fires to a fate scarcely less
dreadful, with other horrors we are unwilling to relate, continued for
three days. One hundred and fifty were slain on the Roanoke, more than
sixty at Newbern, an unknown number near Bath; and the carnage was
stopped only by the exhaustion and besotted drunkenness of the bloodstained
savages. Governor Hyde was powerless to confront the foe.
He could not raise half the number of men the enemy had. The Quakers
were non-combatants; and with them were affiliated many others who
opposed the government. Governor Hyde was compelled to resort to
arbitrary measures in impressing vessels and in procuring provisions for
such troops as he could muster; and these were so inadequate, and so
wide-spread was the Indian combination, that he called for assistance from
Virginia and South Carolina. Both responded with alacrity. While Spotswood
could not supply troops, he checked the further combination of
tribes in his direction. South Carolina sent troops onward through the
forests, under Colonel Barnwell, who defeated the Tuscaroras and put an
end to the war for the time being. But after he retired to South Carolina,
suffering with wounds, the Indians treacherously renewed hostilities;
and it was believed they would soon be joined by more powerful
northward tribes. To add to the calamities of the people, an epidemic
(said to be yellow fever) broke out. The mortality was fearful, and among
the victims was the governor of the colony. The council elected Colonel
Pollock as their president and to act as commander-in-chief. The
following mournful picture is given us from manuscripts left by Colonel
Pollock: “The government was bankrupt, the people impoverished, faction
abundant, the settlements on Neuse and Pamlico destroyed, houses
and property burned, plantations abandoned, trade in ruins, no cargoes
for the few small vessels that came, the Indian war renewed, not men
enough for soldiers, no means to pay them, the whole available force under
arms but one hundred and thirty or forty men, and food for the whole
province to be supplied from the northern counties of Albemarle only.”
South Carolina, being again called on for help, sent Colonel James Moore,
eldest son to Colonel James Moore, late governor of the colony. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
20th of March, 1713, he conquered the last stronghold of the savages,
who soon after, broken and disheartened, left the province in large numbers,
and joined themselves with the Iroquois in what is now the State of
New York. Such of them as remained in North Carolina entered into
a treaty of peace with the whites. During these exhausting calamities
the Proprietors were appealed to; and it was a poor response to refer the
matter to General Nicholson “to enquire into the disorders of North Carolina.”</p>

<p>The next year (May, 1714) Charles Eden, an excellent officer, was appointed
governor. The adherents of Carey, or the popular party, however,
seemed to be actuated against all who were sent to rule the colony. What
grievances they had to palliate or justify their conduct, on this occasion,
we know not; but soon their active opposition had to be dealt with by the
constituted authorities. We shall see, when we treat of South Carolina,
that a few years later the colonists, in that section, threw off, effectually,
the inefficient rule of the Proprietors, and placed themselves under the immediate
control of the Crown; deposing the last proprietary governor, and
electing Colonel Moore governor in the king’s name. It is probable that
the same spirit actuated the people in North Carolina. Yet her historians
have not made it evident that the continued disaffection and turbulence
and rebellion of the people are indications of their readiness to act as their
more southern brethren acted. Perhaps they had not, at that conjuncture,
the same amount of provocation. When we read the letter of the Lords
Proprietors to the council and assembly (June 3, 1723),<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> “We received
an address from you, transmitted some time since by our late governor,
Mr. Eden, wherein you signified to us your great dislike to the rebellious
and tumultuous proceedings of several of the inhabitants of South Carolina,
and your constant and steady adherence to our government and the
present constitution,” we are to bear in mind that this governor and council
were the appointed officers of their lordships. We are to ask, Where
are the records of the assembly,<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>&mdash;records of the thoughts and actions of
the representatives of the people? These, no doubt, will show, if they can
be found, that a spirit of local self-government actuated the people, and is
the thread of development to be followed by the future historian of the
State. We need the testimony of Porter, of Carey, of the able and virtuous
Edward Moseley (chief justice from 1707 to 1711), and of other leaders
of the people against the repressive policy of their lordships in England
and their governors and councils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Some interesting subjects, indicative of the condition of the colony in
these early times, must be briefly noticed: the emission of paper money
consequent upon the expenses of the Indian war; the occasional rating of
commodities for exchange; the indigenous products of the soil and staples
of export; the forwarding of tobacco abroad through Virginia, and troubles
about boundary lines; the customs and modes of life among the gentry or
planters and the humbler classes, and among their close neighbors, the
Indian tribes; the visits of pirates to the coast, both in North and South
Carolina, notably Teach or Blackbeard, and the romantic defeat of him in
Pamlico Sound; the settling, at first, along the streams, which became the
principal highways for travel and commerce; the ill effects necessarily
resulting from the habitations being far apart, and from the fact that there
was very little social intercourse; the transmission of letters only by special
messengers; the disadvantageous nature of the coast section, retarding
the prosperity of the colony.</p>

<p>During the proprietary period, or the first sixty-six years of the colony,
the people clung to the seaboard and that part of it which had no good
port of entry. This was as great a misfortune as it was to cling to the
border line of Virginia. The accession of population, including foreigners,
came chiefly through that border. In 1690 and again in 1707, bodies of
French Protestants arrived, and settled in Pamlico and on the Neuse and
Trent; and three years after some Swiss and Germans settled at Newbern.
The whites in the province numbered at this time about 5,000. Large
tracts of unoccupied land lay between the selected points of settlement. A
few towns had been begun: the first, forty-two years after the first settling
in the province. If a good harbor had been selected and a town properly
fortified built there for exports, the progress of North Carolina might have
been more rapid and substantial. The metropolis was Edenton (founded
1715) on the Chowan. The legislature met there. It contained forty or
fifty houses. There was no church there. The Rev. Dr. Hawks says:
“For long, long years there were no places of worship. They never
amounted to more than some half dozen of all sorts, while the Proprietors
owned Carolina; and when their unblessed dominion ended, there was not
a minister of Christ living in the province.” There had been, however,
missionaries sent out by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel;
and there were some pious gentlemen in the colony who gave them welcome
and all the assistance in their power. But while a few of the missionaries
were exemplary and accomplished much good, others were a positive
hindrance to “the propagation of the gospel.”</p>

<p>Among the misfortunes of the colonists we must not fail to notice the
incompetent governors sent from England. Favoritism, and not fitness for
office, dictated the selection. Archdale, Hyde, and Eden are considered
the only governors sent to the province who did it much service. The last
two whom their lordships favored with the dignity of executive authority
were Burrington, pronounced “a profligate blackguard,” and Sir Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Everard, whom his superseded rival railed against as “a noodle and an
ape,” and “no more fit to be a governor than Sancho Panza.” It was in
the administration of Sir Richard that the colony passed by purchase under
the immediate control of the king. Two thousand five hundred pounds
sterling were paid for each of seven shares; Lord Carteret declining to
dispose of his, as it had come to him by inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> The claims for
arrears of quit-rent due from settlers were also purchased. Before the
surrender of the charter many changes had occurred in the ownership of
shares in the province; and not one of the original Proprietors remained
alive to witness the failure of their successors in the noble enterprise committed
to their management by the munificence of Charles II.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Royal Government.</span>&mdash;The method of the royal government will be
noticed when we come to write of South Carolina. The more thoughtful
in North Carolina no doubt felt relieved in escaping from the negligent
rule of the Proprietors; but the transition from the old to the new form
of administration appears to have been a matter of indifference to the
people at large. All they saw in 1731 was that George Burrington, who
had been displaced for Everard in 1725, came back with a commission
as the first royal governor, to displace in turn his former rival. Burrington,
favored for his father’s services to the king, was unsuited for his
position, and soon became involved in disputes with his council, the assembly,
and the judges. He appeared to think the foremost duty of the
assembly was to provide for him a salary suitable to his new dignity, to
raise money for other royal officers and an adequate and permanent revenue
for the king. The assembly was prorogued for declining to do so.
His violence and tyranny caused complaints against him to be sent,
through Chief Justice Smith, to the authorities in the mother country.
One service, however, he rendered, in conciliating the Indians on the
western border. To this end he sent Dr. John Brickell with a party of
ten men and two Indian hunters to assist them.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> The account of the expedition
adds to our knowledge of the condition of that remote section of
the province, as the interesting work of Lawson does with respect to
other sections. In 1734, on the return of the chief justice, the governor
retired to Charleston and sailed thence to England. Soon afterwards he
was found murdered in St. James’ Park, in London.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Nathaniel Rice,
secretary of the province, and the first named of the councillors, administered
the government from April till November, when Gabriel Johnston,
a Scotchman and man of letters, received, through the influence of his
patron, Lord Wilmington, the royal appointment. For nearly twenty
years he prudently administered the affairs of the colony. At first he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
found a formidable obstacle to a successful management of the people in
their disregard of laws and of gubernatorial dignitaries, imposed upon
them by foreign authority. Many hard things have been said of the people
by those who, perhaps, did not consider the neglect, mismanagement,
and tyrannical provocation under which they lived for two generations,
and the increasing intercolonial influences in behalf of popular sovereignty.
One of the Virginia commissioners, for laying off (in 1727) the
northern boundary, states that the borderers preferred to belong to the
Carolina side, “where they pay no tribute to God or to Cæsar.” Governor
Johnston, at this time, was in need of the latter kind of tribute. The
salaries of the crown officers were to be paid from quit-rents due to the
Crown, the collection of which depended on enactments of the assembly.
The governor, finding great difficulty in having a satisfactory enactment
passed, prorogued the assembly and attempted to collect the rents on his
own authority. Not only was this resisted by the people, but the assembly,
being again convened, denied the legality of the acts of the governor,
and imprisoned his officers who had distrained for the rents.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> The assembly
was consequently dissolved (March, 1736). At the next session,
in the following September, the governor addressed the representatives
of the people on the general condition of the province, the lack of moral
and educational advancement, and of proper regard for law and good
order, and assured them “that while he was obliged by his instructions
to maintain the rights of the Crown, he would show a regard to the privileges,
liberties, and happiness of the people.” In the spirit of compromise
a law was passed with the concurrence of the governor, but which the
authorities in England rejected as yielding too much to the demands of
the popular assembly.</p>

<p>At this time (1738) commissioners were empowered to run the boundary
between North and South Carolina, and completed the work from
the Atlantic as far westward as the Pee Dee. The original division of the
coast section into three counties&mdash;Albemarle with six precincts, Bath with
four precincts, and Clarendon with one (New Hanover)&mdash;was altered, and
the precincts were denominated counties. The very names of the original
counties disappeared. Soon other counties westward or inland were
formed as the population increased, chiefly by overland immigration. To
each county the governor appointed a sheriff, selected from three persons
recommended by the county court. The judiciary system was modified
to suit the new administration and augmentation of population. The
governor had before (1736) deplored the fact that no provision had been
made “or care taken to inspire the youth with generous sentiments,
worthy principles, or the least tincture of literature;” but not until 1754
was an act passed to establish a public seminary. It did not receive the
royal assent. That there were not many schools is doubtless due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
sparseness of settlements, and not to any general indifference to education.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
During the period of the royal government there were two schools
that we read of,&mdash;those at Newbern and Edenton. In the building of
the former, a wooden structure, the lower house of assembly occasionally
held its sessions. In 1749, printing was introduced at Newbern, from
Virginia; and a weekly paper styled the <i>North Carolina Gazette</i>, issued
“on a sheet of post-sized folio,”&mdash;“with freshest advices, foreign and
domestic.” In 1752 appeared the first edition of the <i>Provincial Laws</i>.</p>

<p>At the town of Wilmington, so named in honor of the Governor’s patron,
and sometimes at Newbern, the assembly now met instead of at
Edenton, near the Virginia boundary. A new assembly was convened
at Wilmington, and an attempt was made to establish an equalization of
representation, with a consequent diminution of the number of representatives
from the old and more northern counties,&mdash;from five members
each to two members.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Dissatisfaction was the result; and the six northern
counties would neither recognize the assembly at Wilmington nor pay
taxes, nor would the jurors attend the courts. The colony, however, was
more thriving than it had been at any previous period. It was favored
by the mother country with bounties on its exports; and the general prosperity
was augmented by the coming in of the banished Highlanders and
of emigrants from Ireland, and especially by the beginning of the great
flow of overland immigration into the central and more western section
of the province. Under the prudent management of Johnston, harmony
at last prevailed, and such laws were enacted as were necessary. On the
declaration of war between England and France, the defences of the coast
received legislative attention, and a fort mounting twenty-four cannon was
erected on the south bank of the Cape Fear, and called Fort Johnston,
in honor of the governor.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>Governor Johnston died in August, 1752. What he had written to the
Duke of Newcastle, in 1739, was now even more applicable, that after
years of effort he had brought the colony “to system, where disorder had
before reigned, and placed it on a firmer foundation.” The administration
again devolved on Nathaniel Rice; and on his decease in January, Matthew
Rowan, the next councillor, acted as governor till the arrival of
Arthur Dobbs, in 1754. Rowan’s short term of service was distinguished
by liberal contributions for building churches and purchasing glebe lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
for the support of ministers of the gospel; and by the convening of the
assembly to provide for aiding Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia, by whose
order George Washington had gone to examine the alarming movements
of the French on the Ohio. The militia of North Carolina amounted at
that time, as stated by Rowan, to 15,400 men.</p>

<p>Besides the early coast-line settlements, and those along the bottom
lands of the northeastern streams, there came, mainly after Braddock’s
defeat, a remarkable tide of immigration from the western frontiers of
Virginia and Pennsylvania into central and western North Carolina. Between
1750 and 1790 the accession to the population is computed<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> to be
as much as 300,000. Many seeking fertile lands moved over into the “Up
Country” of South Carolina, and westward into Tennessee. These hardy
and liberty-loving German and Scotch-Irish settlers formed a section of
North Carolina which for a long time was “distinct in population, religion,
and material interests.” Their final fraternization and blending
in political union with the people of the eastern section is a subject for
the later history of the province and State.</p>

<p>Governor Dobbs, a native of Ireland, and who had been a member of its
Parliament, brought to the colony cannon and firelocks, as a present from
the king; and, as a present from himself, “a number of his relations,
who had hopes of offices and preferments.”<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> While, on the one hand,
he sought to conciliate the Indian tribes, on the other he continuously
embroiled himself in contests with the assembly and on trivial matters.
It was, however, the irrepressible conflict of that day,&mdash;the conflict we
have been expecting all along in this history,&mdash;the outgrowth of antagonism
between the royal prerogatives and the rights and privileges of the
representatives of the people. Contributions of men and money were
called for by the governor for the general defence of the provinces, and
for fortifications within the limits of North Carolina. The assembly were
ever ready to defend their frontiers and render aid to the neighboring
colonies. But in the acts for founding new counties, they disallowed “the
royal prerogative of granting letters of incorporation, ordering and regulating
elections, and establishing fairs and markets.” In enactments for
a new court system, the further emission of paper money, and the appointment
of an agent in England to solicit the affairs of the province,
disputes ensued between the assembly and the executive. A new assembly
being convened was equally jealous of its rights and privileges,
and ably maintained them in lengthy communications to the governor,
but without moving him from his convictions of duty under the royal
instructions. The assembly was prorogued after appointing, by resolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the agent to England, whom the governor had rejected. Upon reassembling,
and again in a new assembly, on various bills the struggle for
legislative rights was continued with the Upper House or council.</p>

<p>Two very different events here arrest our attention: the grant of the
king, through Parliament, of £50,000 to indemnify Virginia, North and
South Carolina, for their war expenses, and the proposal to the colonies
to form a union for common defence against general attacks of the French
and Indians; the one fostering attachment to the Crown, the other teaching
the method of effectual resistance.</p>

<p>Governor Dobbs was now infirm and over eighty years of age, and,
having obtained leave of absence, there was sent over, as Lieutenant-Governor,
the able and energetic William Tryon, a colonel in the Queen’s
Guards, who became, on the decease of Dobbs, in 1765, governor of North
Carolina. He was succeeded by Martin, the last royal governor. We
close this brief narrative, pondering upon the province’s progress in
wealth, population, and political stability; on the intercolonial influences
developing union and constitutional self-government; and on the portentous
shadow of the approaching Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p >SOUTH CAROLINA.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proprietary Government.</span>&mdash;In 1665 the Lords Proprietors placed in
charge of Sir John Yeamans&mdash;whom they had, in January, commissioned
governor of Clarendon county at Cape Fear&mdash;the further discovery of
the Carolina coast southward of the portion embraced in the report of
Hilton, Long, and Fabian in 1663. Yeamans and his party left Barbadoes
in three vessels in October. After separation by a storm, they all
reached the Cape Fear or Charles River. But there a violent gale wrecked
the vessel containing the greater part of their provisions, arms, and ammunition.
Being in distress for supplies, their sloop was despatched to
Virginia for aid, and Yeamans himself returned to Barbadoes, leaving Robert
Sandford in commission to obtain a vessel and complete the exploration
of the southern coast. Sandford appears to have first entered the
North Edisto River, where he met the Cassique of Kiawah, who had traded
with the settlers in Clarendon county, and who now invited Sandford to
his country. But the explorers sailed on to Port Royal, arriving there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
early in July. Their reception was apparently very friendly, and Dr. Henry
Woodward remained among the Indians to learn their language, while a
nephew of the chief accompanied Sandford. They designed, on their
return, to visit Kiawah; but by a mistake of the Indian who acted as
guide, they passed beyond the entrance (now Charleston harbor) which led
to that country, and the wind not being favorable for putting back, the
voyagers proceeded northward and returned to Cape Fear.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>In 1667, the Proprietors took measures to found, in the region reported
on by Sandford, a colony worthy of themselves and of the munificence
of the king in granting them almost royal authority in the extensive territory
lavishly bestowed by the charter. The elaborate plan of government
which Locke assisted in maturing was devised for this new enterprise,
and was solemnly agreed upon as a contract among the Proprietors.
Twelve thousand pounds sterling, a large sum at that day, were expended
in preparation for founding, in what is now South Carolina, a colonial government
calculated to bring both glory and emolument to their lordships.
In August, 1669, three vessels were ready to sail from England: the
“Carolina” frigate, the “Port Royall,” and the sloop “Albemarle.” On
board the first-named were ninety-three passengers. How many were in
the other vessels is not at present known; but the intention appears to
have been to begin the settlement with at least two hundred. They
stopped at Kinsale in Ireland to take in other emigrants, receiving, however,
only seven; and according to instructions sailed thence to Barbadoes,
which they reached in October. They were to obtain there such plants
as the vine, olive, ginger, cotton, and indigo, and some swine for the new
colony; and, no doubt, as many emigrants as could be induced to join
the expedition. The fleet was consigned to Thomas Colleton, brother of
the Proprietor, Sir Peter Colleton. It seems that the Proprietors were
not pleased with the management of Sir John Yeamans in the previous
expedition and his leaving the perils of exploration to Secretary Sandford;
yet his experience and ability rendered his coöperation desirable,
and power was given him to fill a blank commission sent to him for the
governorship of the new colony. Living in Barbadoes, and familiar with
projects of colonization, he acted on this occasion on behalf of their
lordships, with authority as their lieutenant-general, and assisted and
encouraged the adventurers. But many disasters occurred: at Barbadoes
the “Albemarle” was driven ashore in a gale and lost, in November; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
January the “Port Royall” suffered the same fate at the Bahama Islands.
A sloop obtained at Barbadoes in place of the “Albemarle” became separated
in a storm, and the “Carolina,” in a damaged condition, put in
at Bermuda for repairs. A part of the equipments was lost by the
wrecks; and Yeamans, to the discontent and indignation of the colonists,
withdrew from further participation in their fortunes, saying he was obliged
to return to Barbadoes as one of the commissioners appointed to negotiate
“with French commissioners the affair at St. Christopher’s.” He persuaded
the colonists to take Colonel William Sayle, and inserted his name
as governor in the blank commission sent to him by the Proprietors. He
describes Sayle as “a man of no great sufficiency, yet the ablest I could
then meet with.”<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>The expedition sailed again on the 26th of February, 1670, in the “Carolina”
and a sloop bought at Bermuda (where Sayle had, twenty years
before, founded a colony of Presbyterians).<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> The Barbadoes sloop, with
about thirty persons on board, had gone to Nansemond, Virginia, and
joined the rest of the expedition at Kiawah in the month of May. The
other two vessels, about a fortnight after leaving Bermuda, had reached the
coast at a place called Sewee,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> in March, and proceeded thence to Port
Royal harbor, their point of destination, and where the instructions of the
Proprietors directed them to go. They remained there a few days. Governor
Sayle summoned the <i>freemen</i>, according to instructions annexed to his
commission, and they elected Paul Smith, Robert Donne, Ralph Marshall,
Samuel West, and Joseph Dalton their representatives in the council,
which consisted of ten, the other five being deputies named by the Proprietors.
The governor and council, by the same instructions, were to
select the place for building a fort and a town. Upon examination the land
at Kiawah was judged better, and a more defensible position could there
be found than at Port Royal. A discussion was held, and, the governor
favoring Kiawah, it was determined to remove and settle there permanently.
Weighing anchor, they sailed northward as to their home at last,
and in the month of April selected for their residence a bluff which they
named Albemarle Point, on the western bank of Kiawah River, now called
the Ashley, and began to build a town which they named Charles Town,
and to erect fortifications. Safely settled after a perilous voyage, when
now, borne down with daily toil, they sank to rest, soothing dreams of
prosperity and happiness, no doubt, renewed their courage for the labors
and dangers of the morrow.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The administration of the colony devolved on the governor, representing
the Palatine (the Duke of Albemarle),<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> and the council, representing
partly the other Lords Proprietors and partly the people. On the 4th
July, 1670, the governor and council&mdash;because the freeholders were “nott
neere sufficient to elect a Parliament,” as the instructions required&mdash;promulgated
certain orders for the better observance of the Sabbath; and
a certain William Owens, arguing that a parliament was necessary for such
legislation, persuaded the people to elect one among themselves, “which
they did and returned to said governor.” But this 4th July spirit of independence
was not persisted in, the members elect receding from their
own “election into dignity.”<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> The council continued to exercise all necessary
legislative and judicial as well as executive power, till a parliament
was formed.</p>

<p>Sayle was about eighty years of age and in feeble health, and died on
4th March, 1671, transferring his authority, as he was empowered to do,
on the man of his choice. He selected Joseph West, his able assistant,
who had brought the colonists from England under commission as “Governor
and Commander in Chief of the Fleet.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the English entrenched themselves when the jealous Spaniards
sent a party to attack them; but finding them stronger than they expected,
they returned to St. Augustine. The chief reason for not settling
at Port Royal, as they were directed to do, was evidently the exposure of
that situation to attacks, both from hostile Indians and the Spaniards who
instigated them, and who, from their early exploration and settlement,
claimed the noble harbor, of which Ribault had said, a century before,
the largest ships of France, “yea, the argosies of Venice,” might enter
therein.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>Sayle’s nomination of West, to act with all the authority conferred upon
himself, was of force only till the pleasure of the Proprietors could be
known. When they were informed of Sayle’s decease, they gave the position
of governor to Sir John Yeamans (commission dated August, 1671);
continuing West, however, as superintendent of important interests in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
colony. He was made governor when Yeamans was displaced (1674);
and in December, 1679, their lordships wrote to him, “We are informed
that the Oyster Point is not only a more convenient place to build a town
on than that formerly pitched on by the first settlers, but that people’s inclinations
tend thither; we let you know the Oyster Point is the place we
do appoint for the port town, of which you are to take notice and call it
Charles Town.” The public offices were removed thither and the council
summoned to meet there, and, in 1680, thirty houses were erected. Even
before this, some settlers had left old Charles Town and taken up their residence
at Oyster Point. Great interest was aroused in all that pertained to
the colony by the active exertions and liberal offers of the Proprietors.
Every vessel that sailed to Charles Town brought new-comers. The Proprietors’
trading-ship “Blessing” followed the first expedition, its “main
end” and chief employment being to transport emigrants from Barbadoes,
where Yeamans and Thomas Colleton were to advise and help Captain
Halsted in this work of emigration. The “Carolina,” in a return voyage
from the same island, had brought sixty-four settlers, and the “John and
Thomas” forty-two. In the “Phœnix” from New York a number of German
families arrived, who began to build James Town on the Stono River.
When Sir John Yeamans came to reside at Charles Town (April, 1672) he
brought the first negro slaves into the colony. In 1680, the date of the
removal to Oyster Point, the settlers numbered about 1,200; in 1686, they
were estimated at 2,500, English, Irish, Scotch, French, and Germans. It
is of significance, with respect to the first political acts of these settlers, to
bear in mind that they were mostly dissenters. Boone, agent in London
for a large portion of the people, stated in his petition to the House of
Lords (in 1706) that after the reëstablishment of the Church of England by
the Act of Uniformity, many subjects of the Crown, “who were so unhappy
as to have some scruples about conforming to the rites of said Church, did
transplant themselves and families into said Colony, by means whereof the
greatest part of the inhabitants there were Protestant Dissenters from the
Church of England.” We must remember, too, that religious freedom was
promised as an inducement to emigrate. As Governor Archdale said, the
charter “had an overplus power to grant liberty of conscience, although at
home was a hot persecuting time.” And this overplus power was at first
very fairly used. All denominations lived harmoniously together, till Lord
Granville became Palatine, whose tyrannical disruption of the religious
privileges of the colonists (by excluding dissenters from the colonial legislature)
nearly cost the Proprietors their charter. The felling of forests,
clearing of plantations, experimenting in agricultural products, establishing
stock farms, building habitations, opening a peltry trade with the Indians,
forming military companies for mutual defence against hostile tribes, and
against the French at times, and at times against the Spaniards, exploring
the adjacent country, caring for and nursing the sick who succumbed to
the malarial influences of the sultry low country along the coast, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
settlers were for many years compelled to reside,<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>&mdash;amidst such circumstances
there was no disposition for religious dissension and none for political
differences among themselves. And when political opposition did
arise, it was for civil rights, and between the colonists as one party and the
Lords Proprietors and their official representatives as the other party. The
rights for which they contended against irritating obstacles engendered a
persistent spirit of political advancement which led to the overthrow of the
proprietary government in 1719, and in further development through the
royal administration culminated in constitutional self-government. In this
respect, the history of no other colony presents a more interesting and instructive
record. The awakening of the people to a determined maintenance
of what they deemed right and just began with the stubborn efforts
of the Proprietors to force the colonists to adopt their scheme of government,
the Fundamental Constitutions. The people declared the charter
of Charles II. to be fundamental enough for them. The facts involved in
this contention are now to be related.</p>

<p>Locke and Shaftesbury’s elaborate and cumbrous system, solemnly
adopted by the Proprietors, suited only (if it could be made to suit) a large
population. A copy was sent out for the first governor, but not to be
immediately put in force. He was to govern by “instructions” annexed
to his commission, and prefaced with the words “In regard the number
of the people which will at first be set down at Port Royal will be so
small, together with want of Landgraves and Cassiques, that it will not be
possible to put our Grand Model of government in practice at first;”
the instructions, coming as nigh as practicable to the Grand Model, must
be used instead. The same “paucity of nobility” and people is given as
the reason for two sets of Temporary Laws (1671, 1672) and the Agrarian
Laws (1672). The governor and council are told to follow always the
latest instructions; a prudent order, for they came in so quick succession,
and with so many alterations, that they may have confused the wisest
of governors. In these official papers two principles are prominent: one
that nothing should be debated or voted in the parliament (the majority
representing the people) “but what is proposed to them by the council”
(the majority representing their lordships); the other “that the whole foundation
of the government is settled upon a right and equal distribution of
land,”&mdash;for the Proprietors and provincial aristocracy, first; then the common
people could have their subordinate little share.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Contrast with these official regulations framed in London the actions of
Governor West and his council as recorded in the “Council Journals” for
1671-72, still preserved in the office of the secretary of state. They were
exercising, on account of the “paucity of nobility,” all executive, judicial,
and legislative powers with promptness and energy, and were fully supported
by the people. They proclaimed war against the Kussoe Indians,
had all fire-arms repaired, began to construct a fort, raised military companies,
commissioned their officers, and reduced the enemy to submission.
They heard and decided complaints and legal issues, and punished criminals,
distributed lands, and provided for the health and security of the
community. They denied to Sir John Yeamans, Landgrave though he
was, any claim to gubernatorial authority, under the Fundamental Constitutions,
and had him before their tribunal for cutting timber not his own.
It is said he retired again to Barbadoes. But he was commissioned governor
and reappeared in the colony, and was “disgusted that the people
did not incline to salute him as governor.” In obedience to instructions,
he immediately summoned, by proclamation, the freemen to assemble and
elect a parliament of twenty members, and to select five of their number
to be members of the grand council. This legislative body (April, 1672),
the first we have knowledge of in the colony, had at this time very little
power, compared with the council; but it was destined to become, as the
representative of the people, the most potent factor in the political development
of subsequent years. Sir John Yeamans, two years later, gave
place again (as before stated) to his rival, Colonel West, whom the Proprietors
declared the “fittest man” to be governor.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> He had, more than
any other in the province, promoted the best interests both of the people
and of their lordships. There was some scarcity of provisions at the close
of Yeamans’ administration, and he was charged with exporting, for his
own advantage, too great a quantity of the agricultural products of the
colony. Commotions ensued, and John Culpepper, surveyor, was engaged
in them or instigated them; and having left Charles Town, he found
in North Carolina popular discontents more ready for rebellious activity.
The cause of the commotions at Charles Town does not clearly appear.
The settlement was so prolific in all that sustains life&mdash;in forest, in
fields, in a harbor abounding in fish, in herds of swine and cattle&mdash;that
it is strange to hear of a scarcity of food; even in 1673, when want is
said to have threatened the people, provisions were exported to Barbadoes.</p>

<p>Governor Sayle, for reasons already stated, was not to put in force
altogether the Fundamental Constitutions; there was, however, a copy
“sent under our hands and seales,” as is mentioned in his commission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
The project of founding the new colony was based on this special scheme
of government. It is positively stated by the colonists, in their letter to
Sothel (1691), that this set originally sent bore date July 21, 1669; was
“fairly engrossed in parchment, and signed and sealed” by six of the Proprietors;
and as all persons were required to swear submission to them
<i>before they could take up land</i>, “several hundred of the people arriving
here did swear accordingly.” A MS. copy<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> of this set, but without signatures,
is in the Charleston library. It does not contain the article establishing
the Church of England. In other respects it is as favorable to settlers
as the revised set bearing date March 1, 1669-70, and containing that
article. That many colonists (the majority being dissenters) preferred the
first set sent with Sayle’s commission may thus be reasonably accounted
for. It was afterwards repudiated by the Proprietors (those who were
then Proprietors) as “but a copy of an imperfect original,” to use the
words ascribed to them in the letter to Sothel; and they say themselves
in their letter to the Grand Council, May 13, 1691, “The Constitution,
so-called, and dated 21 July, 1669, we do not nor cannot own as ours.”
The second set was printed, and, it is said, was not known at Ashley River
till February, 1673.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>In 1687, under Governor Colleton, the endeavor to force the adoption
of the Constitutions occasioned such contention between their lordships’
officers and the representatives of the people that no laws were passed
for two years; and as all laws were limited to twenty-three months, there
was in 1690 <i>not one statute law in force</i> in the colony. A new position
was taken and with boldness. “The people having not, according to the
royal charters, assented or approved of any fundamental constitutions in
parliament, have unanimously declared that the government now is to be
directed and managed wholly and solely according to said charters.”
Their revolutionary spirit went still further. The representatives in Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
denied “that any bill must necessarily pass the grand council
before it be read in parliament.” They maintained this position, and in
consequence were dissolved. The Proprietors instructed their favorite,
Landgrave Colleton, brother of one of themselves, to call no more parliaments
“unless some very extraordinary occasion should require it.” Colleton
proclaimed martial law. The Proprietors thought he did right. In
his arrogance, he imprisoned a clergyman and fined him £100 for preaching
what he considered a seditious sermon. The Proprietors thought it best
to remit the fine. The people, however, raised a cry against his “illegal,
tyrannical, and oppressive way of government.” Fortunately for him, Seth
Sothel, a Proprietor by purchase of Clarendon’s share, arrived,&mdash;having
been turned out of North Carolina by its assembly,&mdash;and assumed control
of affairs in the more southern colony, and acted pretty much as he
pleased, till he was turned out of his new position by his colleagues in
London. The Proprietors, by their aristocratic folly, had kept the people
continually studying and maintaining their rights. A new policy began,
about this time, in England,&mdash;to revoke proprietary charters. The spirit,
too, of the colonists, demanded from the Proprietors some conciliatory
concession. Yet it cannot but appear a triumph for the people, and not
a good-will concession, when “the true and absolute” lords wrote to the
Grand Council (1691), almost in the words which they had written to Andrew
Percival and to the provincial authorities,&mdash;as if they wished to
make an emphatic apology,&mdash;that there had been “no alteration made
in any of the Constitutions, but for the greater security of the people of
Carolina from oppression, either by ourselves or our officers, as any one
that will please to peruse the several alterations may plainly perceive; the
last in date still bounding our own power most, and putting more into
the hands of the people.” But they were forced soon&mdash;and it must
have been with some little feeling of vexation&mdash;to acknowledge the failure
of their Grand Model, and to write to their next governor, Ludwell
(who could not conciliate the “factious” assembly), that they now thought
it best for themselves and the colonists to govern by all the powers of the
charter; but that they would part with no power till the people were disposed
to be more orderly. This was written to Ludwell; but to the
public it was at last definitely announced “that as the people have declared
they would rather be governed by the powers granted by the
charter without regard to the Fundamental Constitutions, it will be for
their quiet and the protection of the well-disposed to grant their request.”
The Proprietors, however, still held to the Constitutions as a compact
among themselves and as a regulation of their mutual interests; and
even endeavored once more to tempt the people to adopt some part of
them in the fifth set, reduced to 41 Articles. They were then laid aside
entirely.</p>

<p>The assembly (we shall no longer call them parliament), not yet aware
of the action of the Proprietors, prepared a summary of grievances: that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the latest form of conveying land was not satisfactory; that courts ought
to be regulated by laws made by the assent of the people; that the representatives
of the people are too few in the assembly and not appointed
according to the charter; that the power of enacting necessary laws
should not be obstructed; that the application of the laws of England to
the province ought not to be by authority of a Palatine Court (established
by their lordships), but such laws are applicable of their own force, or are
to be so by act of the assembly; that the powers of the assembly and
the validity of their enactments are not to be judged by inferior courts,
but by the next succeeding General Assembly; that martial law should
not be resorted to except in case of rebellion, tumult, sedition, or invasion;
that there should be more commoners in the council; that the deputies of
the Proprietors were forbidden to confirm a certain set of laws (necessary
at times for the immediate welfare of the people) until their lordships’
assent should be given, which could not be known in the province “in
less time than one year, sometimes two,” and they do not conceive the
Patent of Carolina gives any such powers to their lordships.</p>

<p>There was a further principle announced by the people: that the Proprietors
could send what “instructions” they pleased, but they certainly
could never have intended that they should have the force of statute
laws without the assent and approbation of the people, except in such
matters as wholly belonged to their direction according to the charter.
With so intelligent and progressive a people to control, the almost impotent
“absolute lords” on the other side of the Atlantic might well have
written to Ludwell as they did to Morton, “Are you to govern the people,
or the people you?” Yet a further signal triumph for the people
was at hand. The Proprietors had already seen fit to modify their rule
that the assembly of the people should neither debate nor vote on any
matter except what the Grand Council should propose to them; but their
modification at that time amounted to very little, namely, that if a necessary
law was delayed by the council, and “the majority of the grand
juries of the counties” presented the matter for legislation, then only
might “any of the chambers” take cognizance of it. It was now the
good fortune of Governor Smith,<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> successor to Ludwell, to announce that
“the Proprietors have consented that the proposing power for the making
of laws, which was heretofore lodged in the governor and council
only, is now given to you as well as the present council.”<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Henceforth
the assembly claimed the privileges and usages of the House of Commons
in England.</p>

<p>When there was no longer any reasonable expectation for the adoption
of the Grand Model of government, a carefully prepared set of Instructions,
in 43 Articles, became the rules for the colony, all former Instructions
and Temporary Laws being abrogated, except such as related to
lands. These rules continued as long as the Proprietors owned the province.
It is not necessary to explain them. They were for the interest
of their lordships; simple enough, but establishing a proprietary oligarchy.
The Palatine and three other Proprietors, and, in the colony, the governor
and three other deputies, constituted the governing power, with, apparently,
a complete check upon the representatives of the people. The people
could not complain if their lordships carried out what they wrote to
Ludwell, that “they would part with no power” conferred on them by the
charter “till the people were disposed to be more orderly;” for the people
had demanded to be governed solely by the charter. The prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
question now would be: Do their lordships properly interpret and apply
the powers granted them in the charter?</p>

<p>But fresh political subjects engaged attention: the tenure of lands,
naturalization of the French Huguenots, payment of quit-rents, now for
some years due, the jury laws, and that relating to elections. Governor
Smith lost courage; he could be no champion for their lordships against
his friends and neighbors. The only way out of the difficulties occasioned
by the maladministration of the Proprietors was that some Proprietor
should be sent over “with full power” to heal all grievances. This plan
was adopted. The grandson of Earl Shaftesbury was appointed, but declined
to come. A pious, benevolent Quaker came, John Archdale, whose
policy was a smiling patience, but a strict requisition of every penny
that was due to the “true and absolute lords” of the province,&mdash;himself
among them. He thought his patience would, as he expressed it, allay
their heats. But this could only be done by concessions. He yielded
to their request to have thirty representatives in the assembly. He also
remitted, after a struggle, arrears of quit-rents to Michaelmas, 1695, on
condition that the remaining debts were secured, rents for the future
strictly provided for, and the town fortified by taxation. Some political
advancement was gained by the assembly;<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> the repeal of any law not infringing
on the rights of the Crown or of the Proprietors, or relating to
land, was not to be made without the consent of the General Assembly.
The council, too, was so constituted by the pious Quaker as to be more in
harmony with the dissenters. But he seemed to fear that he might be
prevailed upon to grant too much, and appointing his friend, Joseph Blake,
in his place, hastened away (1696). He lived to see the peace and tranquillity
vanish which he hoped he had firmly established. Two years later
the “House of Commons” petitioned (among other things) for the privilege
of coining; and for the removal of duties on the chief exports from
the colony. They also prayed that no more than 1,000 acres be in future
granted in one piece; that an authenticated copy of the charter be sent
them; and that the colonial authorities have power to repeal laws (if
expedient to do so) which had been confirmed by the Proprietors: and
though some of these things (they said) were beyond their lordships’
power to grant, their interest with the king was great enough to secure
them for their colonists. Their lordships, as might have, been expected,
were astonished that Blake, himself a Proprietor,<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> should allow such an
address to be issued,&mdash;a precedent for so much future evil.</p>

<p>The century now closed. Governor Blake died in 1700. As required
under the 43 Articles, the deputies elected a Landgrave to succeed Blake,
till the Proprietors could be heard from. At first they chose Morton.
He was set aside afterwards by the council, as were all the Landgraves
in the colony, and Colonel James Moore, a deputy, appointed. This competition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
gave origin, for the first time in the history of the colony, to
what may be denominated party strife. Besides Moore, several able leaders
now appeared,&mdash;among them, Major Daniel, Colonel William Rhett,
and Sir Nathaniel Johnson; while to Nicholas Trott the foremost place
must be assigned for distinguished learning and ability. On his arrival
he espoused the popular cause; but with numerous offices and honors
bestowed upon him by the Proprietors, he and his brother-in-law, Colonel
Rhett, became their zealous champions. These able men so largely influenced
their lordships that at a word from them governors and councils
were sometimes set at naught.</p>

<p>At the opening of the new century, we must cease to look upon South
Carolina as the home of indigent emigrants, struggling for subsistence.
While numerous slaves cultivated the extensive plantations, their owners,
educated gentlemen, and here and there of noble families in England,
had abundant leisure for social intercourse, living as they did in proximity
to each other, and in easy access to Charles Town, where the governor
resided, the courts and legislature convened, and the public offices
were kept. The road that led up from the fortified town between the
two broad rivers so enchanted Governor Archdale that he believed no
prince in Europe, with all his art, could make a walk for the whole year
round so pleasant and beautiful. From the road, to the right and to the
left, avenues of water-oaks in mossy festoons, and in spring-time redolent
with jasmines, gave the passer-by glimpses of handsome residences,
from whose spacious verandas could be seen on the east the beautiful
waters of the Bay, on the west the Ashley River. Hospitality, refinement,
and literary culture distinguished the higher class of gentlemen.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Governor Moore and his party gained control of the council by filling
vacancies with those of whose good-will they were assured. But they
ineffectually sought, by every means in their power, to elect a majority
of assembly-men in their interest. Even violence was resorted to, and
some estimable gentlemen, opponents of the party in power, were set upon
and maltreated in the streets. The assembly resolved to investigate the
abuses at the election, and were, therefore, prorogued from time to time;
and it was reported that martial law would be proclaimed. When at last
the assembly convened, they began with recriminations. If the public
welfare had required their counsels, why had the governor, through pique,
prorogued them? And was it true that he designed to menace them with
coercion? “Oh! how is that sacred word Law profaned when joined
with Martial! Have you forgotten your Honor’s own noble endeavor to
vindicate our liberties when Colleton set up this arbitrary rule?”<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> But
further disputation was averted. The governor had planned a secret and
sudden attack on St. Augustine. The assembly joined in the scheme.
They requested him to go as commander instead of Colonel Daniel, whom
he nominated. They voted £2,000; and thought ten vessels and 350
men, with Indian allies, would be a sufficient force. The doors are closed.
Men, and even women, who had been to St. Augustine, are interrogated
concerning its defences. An embargo is laid on the shipping in the
harbor. Moore with about 400 men sets sail, and Daniel with 100 Carolina
troops and about 500 Yemassee Indians march by land. But the
inhabitants of St. Augustine had heard of their coming, and had sent
to Havana for reinforcements. Retreating to their castle, they abandoned
the town to Colonel Daniel, who pillaged it before Moore’s fleet
arrived. Governor Moore and Colonel Daniel united their forces and
laid siege to the castle; but they lacked the necessary artillery for its
reduction, and were compelled to send to Jamaica for it. Unfortunately
the agent sent put back to Charles Town, and the governor sent Colonel
Daniel himself to Jamaica. Before he returned, two Spanish ships appeared
off St. Augustine. Moore instantly burned the town and all his
own ships, and hastened back by land. Colonel Daniel, coming from
Jamaica with the artillery, narrowly escaped the Spanish ships, and was
convoyed to Charles Town by an English man-of-war which he met at
sea. The expense entailed on the colony was £6,000.</p>

<p>When this attack on St. Augustine was planned, it must have been
anticipated in the colony that war would be declared against Spain and
France. The impending danger to South Carolina, a frontier to Spanish
Florida, induced the Proprietors to appoint as governor the soldierly Sir
Nathaniel Johnson (June, 1702). James Moore was made receiver-general;
Nicholas Trott, attorney-general; Job Howes, surveyor-general;
and Rhett, Broughton, and other men of ability, adhering to the government
in its hour of peril, increased thereby the power of the dominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
party. Colonel Moore, being sent out by Johnson (December,
1703) with fifty Carolinians and one thousand Indians, ravaged the country
of the Apalatchees, allies of the Spaniards, and utterly defeated them
and a body of Spanish troops that came to their assistance. Three
years later, in August, when yellow fever was prevalent and five or six
deaths a day, in the small population of Charles Town, was not a rare
occurrence, a French fleet of five vessels under Le Feboure, aided by the
Spanish governor at Havana, suddenly appeared off the harbor. Troops
were disembarked at several points. A council of war was held, and the
Carolinians determined to go out and meet the enemy. Colonel Rhett,
Captains Fenwicke, Cantey, Watson, and others, with many gentlemen as
volunteers, defeated the invaders, and brought 230 French and Spanish
prisoners into town. Thus perished the first attempt to take Charles
Town by a naval force, a feat which never yet has been accomplished.
The governor, handsomely rewarded by the Proprietors, thanked the
troops for their valor and their unanimity at a time when violent estrangements
existed between political parties in the colony.</p>

<p>We must now revert to 1704, and relate the occasion of these estrangements.
The governor and dominant faction favored Episcopacy.
Lord Granville, the new Palatine, was an uncompromising zealot for the
Church of England. It was determined to establish that Church in South
Carolina. This was not contrary to the charter; but most of the colonists
were dissenters, and it would be useless at that juncture to endeavor to
win over a majority of the assembly to the support of such a project.
The assembly stood prorogued to the 10th of May. They were summoned
earlier; and on the 4th a bill was proposed and read, requiring “all
persons that shall hereafter be chosen members of the Commons House of
Assembly, and sit in the same, to take the oaths and subscribe the declaration
appointed by this bill, and to conform to the religious worship of this
Province, according to the Church of England, and to receive the Sacrament
of the Lord’s Supper according to the rites of said Church.”<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> Some
of the members called for the reading of the charter: but the opposition
was soon overcome; the bill passed and was ordered to the governor and
council, who passed it and returned it to the House; Landgrave Morton,
of the council, being denied leave to enter his protest against it. It was
pushed through the requisite proceedings and ratified under date of the
6th. It was passed by one majority,&mdash;twelve for it and eleven against
it; seven members being absent. Some who voted in the negative are
said to have been Episcopalians. The assembly was then prorogued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
till October. It was required by this law that in case a representative
elected refused to qualify as directed, the next on the sheriff’s return
should be entitled to the seat, or the next, and so on till the list was
exhausted; then only should a new writ be issued. The effect was not
only to exclude dissenters, but ten men could elect a member against
the votes of a thousand. Another tyrannical abuse of party power was
exhibited in an Act establishing Religious Worship (passed on the reassembling
of the Commons), which authorized a lay commission for
the trial of ecclesiastical causes. Dalcho says in his <i>Church History</i>, that
they “were authorized to sit in the judgment-seat of spiritual officers, and
thus to wrest the ecclesiastical authority out of the hands of the Bishop
of London.” This gave offence to Churchmen. The Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel, by whose liberality the colony had been
greatly benefited, resolved not to send or support any missionaries in
South Carolina, till the law, or at least that clause of it, should be repealed.
The dissenters, already elected members of assembly, were
not allowed (on reassembling in October) to enter their protests against
the conduct of the Church party. The Rev. Mr. Marston was called to
account by the commission and deprived of his benefice, for opposing
the action of the oligarchy. But the case was carried to a higher tribunal,
the House of Lords in England. Upon an able representation
of the matter, redress having been refused by the Proprietors (under
lead of Granville), a report was made to the queen, which caused the
annulment of these two provincial laws. Nor was this all; the Board
of Trade recommended the annulment of the proprietary charter (April,
1706). Since the accession of James II. there had been a disposition
in the English authorities to revoke the charters to companies or individuals,
and bring all the American colonies into a closer dependence
on the Crown. Though the surrender of the Carolina charter was not
on this occasion effected, yet it was manifest to the colony that an authority
more potent than that of their lordships was interested in their
welfare.</p>

<p>Lord Granville was succeeded in the Palatinate by Lord William
Craven, and Colonel Edward Tynte was made governor. The once
dominant faction, which had been transmuted, said Archdale, by Johnson’s
“chemical wit, zeal, and art” into a High Church party, now
fell asunder. Much attention had been awakened in England to the
fortunes of the colony by the publications of Archdale and of Oldmixon
and the “Case of the Protestant Dissenters;” and Governor Tynte entered
upon his duties with kindly assurances and the wish to “render
Carolina the most flourishing colony in all America.” He did not live
long, and Colonel Charles Craven, brother of the Palatine, and previously an
officer in the colony, was appointed in his place (December, 1710). Since
the days of Joseph West, “moderate, just, pious, valiant” (says Archdale),
no man more capable and beloved than Charles Craven had governed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
South Carolina. A sentence from an address of his to the Commons
(April, 1712) shows the spirit of his administration. However great the
honor of this office might be, “yet I shall look on it as a greater glory if,
with your assistance, I could bring to pass so noble designs as the safety
of this province, the advancement of its riches, and, what is more desirable”
than riches, the unanimity and quiet of its people. “To what a prodigious
height hath the united provinces risen in less than a century of
years, to be able to create fear in some, envy in others, and admiration in
the whole world!” The people, aroused by the expectation or apparent
reality of their increasing importance, voted £1,500 for the erection of a
State House and £1,000 for a residence for the governor. Unparliamentary
altercations gave place to a generous emulation for the public
welfare. The governor expressed the “greatest tenderness” towards all
dissenters and assured them that nothing should ever be done by him injurious
to their liberties. Though the law excluding them from the assembly
was repealed, yet the Episcopal party retained ascendency and the
public support of the Church (by a new Church Act) was continued. The
parish system was inaugurated, and the representatives were increased to
thirty-six. The turbulence of elections at Charles Town gave place to unmolested
elections in the respective parishes. Libraries and a free school
were open to all, and religious and educational advancement was promoted.
Under Craven’s prosperous administration, it even seemed likely that the
public debt would be liquidated, which had begun with the unlucky expedition
against St. Augustine. But fresh expenditures were demanded in
assisting North Carolina in her conflicts with the Tuscaroras; and scarcely
had Barnwell and Moore rested from that campaign, when the most disastrous
Indian war that South Carolina ever had to encounter broke suddenly
upon her unsuspecting inhabitants. The Yemassees had been employed
against the Apalatchees, and, at a later date, against the Tuscaroras. Being
enticed by the Spaniards, whom their chiefs often visited, and being
largely in debt to the English traders and irritated by their oppressive
misconduct, they turned their experience in war against those who had
taught them to fight, and, hoping for help from St. Augustine, began an
indiscriminate slaughter on the line of settlements westward from Charles
Town. Knowing the colonists to be formidable opponents, they had
allured into conspiracy with them other Indian nations, notably the
Creeks. So wide-spread was the combination formed that the governor
asked assistance from other colonies. North Carolina in response sent
aid under Colonel Maurice Moore (brother of James Moore), a friendly
service which was gratefully appreciated and acknowledged by the assembly.
But “expedition is the life of action,” said Craven; and not
awaiting assistance, he fought the foe at once, and Colonel Mackay, in
another direction, surprised their town, in which they had vast quantities
of provisions and plunder, and attacking a fort to which they had
betaken themselves carried it by assault and completely routed them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
This effectually checked the Yemassees, and dispirited the tribes engaged
to assist them. The assembly met, and, despatching such business
as was necessary, adjourned to take up their muskets. All available
forces were raised and placed under command of Lieutenant-General
James Moore and Colonels John Barnwell and Alexander Mackay.
The Yemassees, though joined by the Apalatchees, were forced beyond
the Savannah, and took up their residence in Florida. We have not
space to narrate the heart-rending or romantic incidents of this contest.
The Yemassees had acted prematurely; otherwise the disasters to
the colony would have been far greater. Many lives were lost (estimated
at 400), an immense amount of cattle, produce, and other valuable
property destroyed, and it was said that the traders alone lost
£10,000 in debts due them. But the invincibility of the colonists was
so forcibly impressed upon the minds of the Indians that they entered
into no more combinations, and never again, except in straggling parties,
penetrated to the vicinity of the fortified English settlements.</p>

<p>On account of the death of Sir Anthony Craven, the governor returned
to England, leaving Colonel Robert Daniel to be deputy (1716) till the arrival
of Robert Johnson (son of Sir Nathaniel), who was appointed to succeed
him. At this time the French were extending their cordon of forts
from Canada down to Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, and courting the
alliance of the Indians who dwelt on the outskirts of the whole line of
English colonies. In view of these new dangers and of the deserted condition
of the westward parishes of the colony, the Carolinians were compelled
to keep up garrisons and troops of rangers from the Santee to the
Savannah. The expense of defending themselves and their great losses in
the recent Indian war caused an application to the Proprietors for relief.
Lord Carteret, Palatine in place of the Duke of Beaufort (who, before, had
offered on his part to give up the colony rather than have it in need of adequate
relief and protection), wrote to the Board of Trade, “We, the Proprietors,
having met on this melancholy occasion, to our great grief find that
we are utterly unable of ourselves to afford our colony suitable assistance
in this conjuncture; and unless his majesty will graciously please to interpose,
we can foresee nothing but the utter destruction of his majesty’s
faithful subjects in those parts.” The board asked if such of the Proprietors
as were not minors were “willing to surrender the government to the
king.” There was no king upon the throne now gratefully sensible of the
distinguished services of a Clarendon, Monk, Berkeley, Carteret, or Craven.
It was not, on the other hand, the influences of a Danson, Amy,
Blake, or even the descendants of the original Proprietors, that formed a
barrier to the manifest interests of the whole British nation; but it was
the admirable love of justice in the rulers of England that saved to the
Proprietors the lavish gift of Charles II., even after their confession of
utter inability to help their colonists. It was evident, however, that the
termination of the proprietary authority must come. The colonists made
it come. We shall now relate how this was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>The assembly had been forced to issue bills of credit; at first to meet
the debts incurred by Moore’s expedition against St. Augustine. This easy
method of making money was continued, and of course the bills depreciated.
The London merchants complained, and the bills were ordered to
be called in and cancelled. To do this required £80,000. This large sum
the assembly undertook to pay in three years by a tax on the lands and negroes
of the colonists. Before this could be effected the colonial income,
applicable to other expenses, was reduced by a royal order to cease the tax
of ten per cent on importations of British manufactures; and at the same
time an expensive expedition became necessary to suppress the pirates who
infested the coasts, and at times seized every ship leaving the harbor of
Charles Town. If the Proprietors were unwilling “to expend their English
estates to support much more precarious ones in America,”<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> whom
were the colonists to ask for aid, except the king? When Governor Johnson
met his first assembly, he inveighed against addresses sent to England
without consulting the Proprietors as “disrespectful,” “unjustifiable and
impolitic.” He then offered the distressed colonists a “donative” from
their lordships of a small remission of quit-rents. The assembly declined
the donative. They instructed their committee “to touch slightly (but not
by way of argument or submission) on what the last two assemblies have
done heretofore in addressing his majesty to take this province under his
protection.” The governor was anxious they should accept the donative;
and equally anxious they should, in return, order a rent-roll for the benefit
of the Proprietors. He said, “As the assembly is to pass wholesome laws
even to private persons, much more to the Lords Proprietors, who are our
masters.” The assembly replied, “We cannot but approve of your honor’s
care of their lordships’ interest, who are, as you say, <i>your</i> masters.” “If
you look over their charters,” was the answer, “you will find them to be
your masters likewise.” (December, 1717.)</p>

<p>The assembly elected Colonel Brewton powder-receiver. The governor,
as military chief, required the assembly to order forthwith the keys to be
delivered to Major Blakeway, whom he had commissioned. The House refused.
The governor offered a compromise: “My officer shall keep the
magazines and give receipts to your officer for all powder delivered into his
keeping.” “What is the use,” replied the House, “of a powder-receiver
who does not keep the powder?” “But I insist upon keeping it,” said
the governor, “for I am his majesty the king’s lieutenant.” He soon
saw an advertisement by the House, signed by their Speaker, declaring
their right to appoint “all officers who receive a settled salary out of the
public treasury of this province,” and to “put out, call to account, and
put in place,” at discretion, all such officers; and commanding, under penalty,
the powder-tax to be paid by all ships to the officer elected by the
assembly.</p>

<p>The people, however, were fond of Governor Johnson. They did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
always harmonize with strangers sent over to govern them. But Johnson
was almost one of themselves, and they admired him for his conspicuous
bravery. He had gone personally in pursuit of the pirate Worley, and after
a desperate encounter brought in alive only the chief and one of his crew,
they having been smitten down with dangerous wounds; and he had immediately
caused them to be tried and executed. At this time, too, Colonel
Rhett had captured Bonnet, pursuing him into Cape Fear River, and
brought him and about thirty of his crew to Charles Town, for speedy
execution. The people knew that the governor was in duty bound to promote
the cause of the Proprietors. But some of his adherents they justly
regarded with ill-will. There had been, as before mentioned, a change,
very acceptable to the people, in the mode of electing their representatives.
Trott and Rhett had had great control in elections while the ballot
was in Charles Town; and the former had been writing to their lordships
against the new method of election by parishes. To the surprise of the
governor and of all but Trott, orders came from London to disallow that
method, to dissolve the assembly, and to summon another to be chosen
by the old method; to repeal also the act for electing the powder-receiver,
and other laws, such as that for the rehabitation of the Yemassee lands by
bringing over Irish settlers to live there, which the people deemed of great
importance to the welfare of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> The argument was, with their
lordships, What right have the assembly to alter anything determined by
us? It is true our deputies sanctioned these laws; but we are not bound
by what our deputies do, being ourselves the head and source of legislative
power in our colony. The people thought, on the other hand, that an
enactment by the assembly ratified by the governor and council, the appointed
agents of the Proprietors, should not be set aside by the mere
whim of a few persons on the other side of the Atlantic, or by the dictation
of a man like Nicholas Trott. This gentleman had now to confront
the long-delayed denunciation of Whittaker, Allein, and other prominent
lawyers, who had for years endured his arrogance and tyranny in court.
Thirty-one articles of complaint against him were presented to the assembly,
and by them communicated to the governor and council. They knew
the allegations to be well founded, and united with the assembly in requesting
the Proprietors to restrict their favorite’s power. It had even been
ordered from London that no quorum of the council should sanction a law
unless Trott was one of the quorum. For a time, too, the whole judicial
power was in his hands. Francis Yonge, a member of the council, deputy
of Lord Carteret, and surveyor-general, was deputed, with suitable instructions,
to proceed to London and confer with the Proprietors (May, 1719).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Lord Carteret was absent on an embassy. The others kept Mr. Yonge
waiting, without conference, for three months; then sent him back with
sealed orders. In fact, some of the Proprietors were minors; others lived
away from London; the few who exercised authority left many matters to
their secretary: and thus, says Yonge, “a whole province was to be governed
by the caprice of one man.” If the secretary managed the Proprietors,
Trott and Rhett managed him. When the sealed orders were opened,
it was found that Chief Justice Trott was thanked, the governor reprimanded,
his brother-in-law, Colonel Broughton, turned out of the council,
together with Alexander Skene and James Kinloch; Mr. Yonge alone being
permitted to remain, in courtesy to the absent Palatine (Carteret) whose
deputy he was. A new council was appointed, and the governor again
ordered to dissolve the assembly and call a new one under the old method
of election.</p>

<p>The deputies excluded from the council and other prominent gentlemen
now became active among the people. The arguments they used must
have been: Have not the Proprietors, spurning all appeals, protected a tyrannical
judge, and continued him in power over the lives and property of
the people? Have they not refused to part with an acre of their immense
uncultivated domains for public use in supporting the garrisons? Have
they not obstructed our efforts to bring an increase of settlers here for the
strengthening of our frontiers, and divided out the land, by thousands of
acres, for their own emolument? To foster the power of a few favorites,
have they not annulled our laws for the equitable representation of the
people by fair and peaceful elections? Have they helped the colony in its
distress, beat back the Spaniards, resisted the invasion of the French, suppressed
the pirates, or quelled at any time an Indian horde? Can they
now, masters as they claim to be, protect us in any emergency? And if,
after all these provocations, we choose to rebel and throw off their vaunted
absolutism, where are their forces to check our revolt? Will King George,
our sovereign, to whom we appeal for protection, furnish them with an
army to reduce us to submission? Influenced by such sentiments, the
people came again to the polls at Charles Town, to elect their last assembly
under the proprietary government. Mr. Yonge, who was there, tells us,
“Mr. Rhett and Mr. Trott found themselves mistaken, in fancying they
could influence the elections when in town, so as to have such members
chosen as they liked, for it proved quite the contrary; they could not get
so much as a man chosen that they desired. The whole people in general
were prejudiced against the Lords Proprietors to such a degree that it was
grown almost dangerous to say anything in their favor.”</p>

<p>It happened at this conjuncture that war was again declared by England
against Spain, and an attack from Havana was in preparation either
on Charles Town or the island of Providence. Advices being sent to
the colony, the governor called together the council and such members
elect of the assembly as he could collect, to provide for repairing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
fortifications; and as the recent repeals had left him without adequate
funds, he proposed an immediate voluntary subscription. The members
of the assembly whom he consulted told him the duties provided by law
would suffice. “But the Act raising these duties is repealed by the Proprietors.”
They replied, “They did not and would not look on <i>their</i> repeal
as anything,” and dispersed to their homes. The governor then
ordered a muster of all the provincial troops. This afforded an admirable
opportunity for a complete combination. An association of leading
citizens was secretly formed; the people assembled at the muster;
they almost unanimously signed the resolutions submitted to them by the
association, and agreed to support whatever measures they should adopt.
The first notice the governor had of these proceedings was a letter
signed by Mr. Skene, Colonel Logan, and Major Blakeway (28th November),
telling him the whole province had entered into an agreement
“to stand by their rights and privileges, and to get rid of the oppression
and arbitrary dealings of the Lords Proprietors,” and inviting him to
hold his office in behalf of the king. The members elect of the assembly,
in the mean while, held private conferences and matured their
plans.</p>

<p>On meeting at the time required by their writs (December 17), they
waited upon the governor, as was customary; and Mr. Middleton, in
their name, informed him that they did not look upon his present council
as a legal one (the Proprietors having appointed twelve members, instead
of seven, the usual number of deputies), and would not act with
them as a legal council. Anticipating, it appears, a dissolution, they had
resolved themselves into a convention, delegated by the people, and passed
resolutions so revolutionary in character as to alarm the governor and his
few adherents, who resorted to every menace and means of persuasion
without moving the assembly or convention from their fixed purposes.
The governor, therefore, issued a proclamation dissolving them. The proclamation
was torn from the marshal’s hands; and the convention issued
a proclamation, in their own names, ordering all officers, civil and military,
to hold their offices till further orders from them. Having failed to win
Johnson to their interest, they elected their own governor, Colonel James
Moore.</p>

<p>Johnson, who had gone up to his plantation, hearing that the people
intended to proclaim Moore governor in the king’s name, hastened
back and used every effort to prevent it. But he found the militia drawn
up, colors flying at the forts and on all the ships in the harbor, drums
beating, and every preparation made for proclaiming the new governor.
An eye-witness says it would be tedious to tell all the frantic ex-governor
did. But the leaders of the revolution had sent Mr. Lloyd to keep with
him under pretence of friendship and adherence, and prevent any rash
action on his part. The troops began their march, inspirited by patriotic
harangues, and escorted the members of the convention to the fort:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
where, by the united acclamations of the people, James Moore was proclaimed
governor of South Carolina in the name of the king of England
(December 21, 1719).</p>

<p>A council of twelve was chosen, as in other colonies under the royal
government; and the convention then resumed its functions as a legislative
assembly, and proceeded to enact such laws as the state of the
province required. They addressed a letter to the Board of Trade explanatory
of their action, and their agent in England (Mr. Boone, with whom
also Colonel Barnwell was sent to act) laid before the king an account
of the misrule of the Proprietors and implored his protection. Johnson
and the Proprietors were equally active, and the decision of the English
government was anxiously awaited by both parties. During nearly a year
such anxiety continued; and as the clergy in the province were unwilling
to perform the marriage ceremony without, as previously, a license from
Johnson as governor, and a large number of people followed his advice
and example in not paying taxes until executions were issued against
them, he supposed he had a party ready to reinstate him. But it was
not till he received aid from the crews of several English men-of-war that
he formed a plan of seizing the government. The Spanish fleet (to resist
which the people had been mustered) had not come to Charlestown, but
had gone to the island of Providence, and had been there repulsed by
Governor Rogers. The “Flamborough,” Captain Hildesley, and “Phœnix,”
Captain Pearce, arrived in Charlestown harbor in May, 1721; and
chiefly, it appears, by the advice of Hildesley, Johnson appeared in arms
with about 120 men, mostly sailors from the “Flamborough,” and marched
against the forts, whose garrisons were obeying the orders of Governor
Moore. The forts opened fire upon them. Whereupon, Captain Pearce
was deputed by Johnson, together with some of his council, to negotiate
with the revolutionists. They refused to negotiate; for they knew from
their agents that the regency in England had determined to protect the
colony, and that General Francis Nicholson had been appointed provisional
royal governor. Johnson requested to see the orders of the regency
and the despatches from the agents. As soon as he read them, he disbanded
his men and gave up all opposition to the existing government.
Nicholson’s commission is dated 26th September, 1720. He arrived in
the colony 23d May, 1721, and was gladly received by Governor Moore,
the assembly, and the people. The revolution was now complete; although
the surrender of the proprietary charter, for such a sum of
money as was finally agreed upon, was not effected till 1729.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Royal Government.</span>&mdash;We have before us the ninety-six articles of
instruction to Nicholson (30th August, 1720) and the additional ones to
Governor Johnson (1730), detailing the method of the royal government,
and which continued in force, with some modifications, till the separation
of the colony from the mother country. It is not necessary to give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
full synopsis of this method. The enacting clause is “by the governor,
council, and assembly;” and the assembly had the same powers and
privileges as were allowed to the House of Commons in England. The
Episcopal was the established Church, under jurisdiction of the Bishop of
London. School-masters were licensed by the bishop or by the governor.
If the governor died or left the province, and there was no commissioned
lieutenant-governor, the eldest councillor, as president, acted in his stead.
Special care was enjoined for the encouragement of the Royal African
Company for the importation of negro slaves. If any part of the instructions
was distasteful to the people, it was that which conferred equal
legislative authority with the assembly upon the council; a council of
twelve, nominated (or suspended) by the governor, and three of whom,
with the governor, could form a quorum, in emergencies. On this point
contests soon arose, the assembly thinking that the governor and three
or more of their own neighbors or relatives, who happened to be councillors,
ought not to have the power to counteract the deliberate will of
the entire body of the representatives of the people; that is, of the freeholders
who alone voted for members of the assembly.</p>

<p>But, for the time being, all were happy at their release from “the confused,
negligent, and helpless government of the Lords Proprietors.” Governor
Nicholson, on his arrival, found in all parties a cheerful allegiance
to the king and zeal for the advancement of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Ex-Governor
Moore was made Speaker of the assembly, with Nicholson’s cordial approbation,
and all laws demanded by the condition of the province were
promptly enacted. Peace having been declared between England and
Spain, the new governor applied himself to the regulation of Indian affairs,
and succeeded in bringing the tribes on the frontier into alliance
with British interests. With peace and security everywhere, he addressed
himself to forming new parishes, building churches and obtaining clergymen
by the help of the London Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.
Additional free schools were established by bequests from three
benevolent citizens, and the people generally emulated the public spirit
of their good governor. In 1725 he returned to England, and the administration
of his office devolved upon Arthur Middleton as president
of the council. He had it not in his power to be the generous benefactor
Nicholson had been, and his views of duty to the royal authority
placed him in opposition to the progressive spirit of those with whom he
had been associated in the recent revolution. His stubborn contest with
the assembly prevented the enactment of any laws for three years.
They thought it necessary for the good of the people to pass a bill for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
promoting the currency of gold and silver in the province. The council
rejected it as contravening an act of Parliament in the reign of Queen
Anne; and insisted on the passage of a supply bill by the assembly, to
meet the expenses of the government. This the assembly refused unless
their bill was first agreed to. Middleton resorted to prorogations and dissolutions.
This availed nothing; for the people supported their representatives
by reëlecting them. From 1727 to 1731 the same bill was eight
times sent up to the president and his council, and always rejected. He
prorogued them six times, and six times ordered new elections. Among
other things in this contest, the assembly claimed the right to elect their
clerk without consulting the council;<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> ordered an officer of the council to
their bar, and put him under arrest for delay in making his appearance;
and maintained that&mdash;as in Nicholson’s time&mdash;members elect should
qualify by holding up the hand in taking the oath before the council, if
they thought that best, instead of swearing on the Holy Evangelists, as
the governor required them to do. The contest was not terminated
until the arrival of Governor Johnson (December, 1730) as successor to
Nicholson.</p>

<p>Sir Alexander Cumming had been sent to form a treaty with the Cherokees
who lived near the head of the Savannah River and far westward,&mdash;a
powerful nation with 6,000 warriors. They sent a deputation of their
chiefs to England with Cumming to visit King George. It was important
to secure the friendship of these Indians before the French should allure
them to their interest. The chiefs returned from England in company
with Governor Johnson. Middleton had before sent agents among the
Creeks and Cherokees, to avert, if possible, the influence of the French,
whose enterprise and energy were likely to become more formidable to the
English settlements than the hostility of the Spaniards had been. While
guarding against danger in this direction, they had to contend against
molestations from their inveterate enemy in Florida. Runaway slaves
were always welcomed there, were made free, and formed into military
companies. Roving bands of the defeated Yemassees from the same refuge-place
plundered the plantations on the frontier. No compensation
could be obtained for such ruthless spoliation. At length Colonel Palmer
was sent to make reprisals; and with about 300 men, militia and friendly
Indians, he completely laid waste the enemy’s country up to the gates of
St. Augustine, and taught them their weakness and the superior power of
the English colonists. Unfortunately, no definite boundaries were settled
upon between the claims of Spain and England.</p>

<p>The colonial government,
however, had erected in Governor Nicholson’s time Fort King
George on the Altamaha, and were determined to keep the Spaniards to
the westward of that river. A Spanish embassy came to Charlestown to
confer with President Middleton about the erection of this fort. But the
only definite understanding reached was in the avowal by the ambassadors
that his Catholic majesty would never consent to deliver up runaway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
slaves, because he desired to save their souls by converting them to the
Christian faith. Cunning emissaries from St. Augustine continued to tamper
with the slaves, and rendered many of them dangerous malcontents.
Not long after (1738) an armed insurrection was attempted in the heart
of the English settlement; the negroes on Stono River marching about
plundering, burning farm-houses, and murdering the defenceless. The
planters at that time went to church armed. It was Sunday. Lieutenant-Governor
Bull, riding alone on the road, met the insurgents, and escaping
them by turning off on another road gave the alarm. The male part
of the Presbyterian congregation at Wiltown&mdash;notified of the insurrection
by a Mr. Golightly&mdash;left the women in church, and hastening after
the murderous horde found them drinking and dancing in a field, within
sight of the last dwelling they had pillaged and set on fire. Their leader
was shot, some were taken prisoners and the rest dispersed. More than
twenty persons had been murdered. It might have been an extensive
massacre, if so many armed planters had not attended divine service
that day.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

of Charlestown in 1762 is given in the <i>Charleston
Year Book</i>, 1882; and in Cassell’s <i>United States</i>,
i. 355. The name “Charleston” was substituted
for “Charlestown” in the act of incorporation of
1783.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>There were in the colony above 40,000 negro slaves. The necessity for
increasing the number of white inhabitants had long been apparent to the
English authorities. Some of the German Palatines in England (1729)
and more of them in 1764 were sent over to the colony. Mr. Purry, of
Neufchatel, and his Swiss were granted (1732) an extensive tract of land
near the Savannah River. Some Irish colonists settled at Williamsburgh
(1733). Colonel Johnson, before he came over as royal governor, proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
to the Board of Trade a plan for forming a number of townships at convenient
points, with great inducements to both foreigners and Englishmen
to remove to the province. Above all, the proposal by Lord Percival
(1730) to establish the colony of Georgia (between the Savannah and Altamaha),
and the carrying of the project into effect under General Oglethorpe
(1733), gave promise of adding materially to the security and strength of
South Carolina. With a new fort at Beaufort (Port Royal), and abundant
artillery and ammunition furnished by his majesty, and ships of war protecting
the harbor, we have but to look forward a few years to the settlement
and improvement of the healthy and fertile “up country” by overland
immigration from Virginia and Pennsylvania, and the moving up of
population from the coast, to reach the period of permanent prosperity and
the greater development of the material resources of the province. Many
families moved to the upper part of South Carolina when Governor Glen
established peace with the Cherokees; many came when Braddock’s defeat
exposed the frontiers of the more northern colonies to the French and
Indians; while by way of Charlestown Germans came up to Saxegotha and
the forks of the Broad and Saluda&mdash;as the Scotch-Irish had come to
Williamsburg.</p>

<p>From 200 to 300 ships now annually left Charlestown. In addition to
rice, indigo, pitch, turpentine, tar, rosin, timber of various kinds, deer-skins,
salted provisions, and agricultural products grown along the coast,
the interior plantations raised wheat, hemp, flax, and tobacco; fruits, berries,
nuts, and many kinds of vegetables were abundant; and fish from
the rivers, and turkeys and deer and other game from the forest, furnished
luxuries for the table, without counting the ever-present supplies from
swine, sheep, and cattle. But we must now go back a few years.</p>

<p>Governor Johnson died 3d May, 1735, and Lieutenant-Governor Thomas
Broughton on 22d November, 1737. William Bull, president of the council,
succeeded to the administration till the arrival of Governor James Glen
(December, 1743).<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> The lieutenant-governor was a prudent ruler. He
assisted in the settlement of Savannah and in the war of Georgia upon
St. Augustine (sending the Carolina regiment under Colonel Vanderdussen),
and managed wisely in every emergency. Governor Glen with
greater energy and activity extended the fortification of the province,&mdash;visiting
every portion of his government, going among the Cherokees,
obtaining a surrender of their lands for the erection of forts, and erecting
them; as Prince George on the upper part of the Savannah, 170 miles
above Fort Moore, and Fort Loudon on the Tennessee among the Upper
Cherokees, 500 miles from Charlestown. These forts and those at Frederica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and Augusta in Georgia were garrisoned by his majesty’s troops for the
protection of both provinces. When Glen, in 1756, was superseded by
Governor William Henry Lyttleton, war was declared between England
and France. On the termination of hostilities, the Cherokees, who had
aided the British troops in the more northern colonies, were returning
home through Western Virginia, and committed depredations, appropriating
to their use such horses as came in their way, and were set upon and
some of them murdered. In retaliation they killed the whites wherever
they could, indiscriminately. Among their victims in Carolina were a few
of the garrison of Fort Loudon. This was done by roving bands of headstrong
young Indians. The troops at Prince George despatched the news
to Governor Lyttleton, who instantly began preparations for war. The
Cherokees sent thirty-two of their chiefs to settle the difficulty, as the
nation at large desired peace and the continuation of their old friendship
with the English. Lyttleton kept the chiefs under arrest, and took them
with him along with his troops. His ill-usage of them and his folly
involved the province in a disastrous war with the whole Cherokee nation.
Then, being appointed Governor of Jamaica, he left the calamities he had
caused to the management of Lieutenant-Governor Bull. Not till 1761
were hostilities ended by the help of Colonel Grant, of the British army.
Dr. Hewatt, who had the advantage of the acquaintance of the last Lieutenant-Governor
Bull, and probably his assistance in the compilation of
his history, gives a detailed and graphic narrative of this deplorable conflict,
carried on in pathless forests, hundreds of miles from Charlestown.
So wasted were Colonel Grant’s men “by heat, thirst, watching, danger,
and fatigue” that when peace was made “they were utterly unable to
march farther.” In the provincial regiment assisting Grant were Middleton,
Laurens, Moultrie, Marion, Huger, Pickens, and others who became
distinguished in the war of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The Peace of Paris (1763) happily put an end forever to hostilities arising
from French possessions in America. The succeeding royal governors
of South Carolina were Thomas Boone (1762), Lord Charles Greville
Montague (December, 1765), and Lord William Campbell (1773).</p>

<p>The most interesting and continuous thread of events running through
all the colonial history of South Carolina is the development of the power
of the assembly or representatives of the people. Taking up this subject
where we left it at the close of Middleton’s contest with the assembly, we
observe that the choice of their clerk was conceded to them by the succeeding
governor. In the policy both of the proprietary and royal government,
the elective franchise was granted to the people or freeholders
only in choosing members of the assembly. We do not find that they
balloted for any executive or other officer. The success of the assembly
in electing a few administrative officers and holding them accountable to
themselves was an important acquisition, and was followed by a further
gain of power in the same direction. Governor Glen, addressing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
authorities in England (October 10, 1748), said in substance “that a new
modelling<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> of their constitution,” in South Carolina, “would add to the
happiness of the province and preserve their dependence upon the Crown,
any weakening [of the] power of which and deviation from the constitution
of the mother country is in his opinion dangerous. Almost all the
places of profit or of trust are disposed of by the general assembly.” “Besides
the treasurer they appoint also the commissary, the Indian commissioner,
the comptroller of the duties upon imports and exports, the powder-receiver,
etc. The executive part of the government is lodged in different
sets of commissioners,” “of the market, the workhouse, of the pilots,
of the fortifications, etc. Not only civil posts, but ecclesiastical preferment,
are in the disposal or election of the people, although by the king’s instructions
to the governor” this should belong to the king or his representative.
The governor is not prayed for, while the assembly is, during its
sittings, the only instance in America where it is not done. “The above
officers and most of the commissioners are named by the general assembly,
and are responsible to them alone; and whatever be their ignorance,
neglect, or misconduct, the governor has no power to reprove or displace
them. Thus the people have the whole of the administration in their
hands, and the governor, and thereby the Crown, is stripped of its power.”
In the next place, the assembly claimed, and with success, the sole power
of originating tax bills, notwithstanding instructions to the contrary.
They refused to the council even the power to amend such bills. In
the words of the Journals of the House (no. 21, 1745), they asserted
their “sole right of introducing, framing, and amending subsidy bills,”&mdash;which
they based on the English Constitution as <i>paramount to the royal
instructions</i>. It was furthermore intimated that the council had no right
to legislative functions at all,&mdash;a view soon after ably advocated by Mr.
Drayton. It was contended that the council was not a counterpart of the
House of Lords, but simply a body advisory to the governor. It was even
argued that, similarly with the mother country, colonial usages and precedents
were to be regarded as constitutional in South Carolina.</p>

<p>The last development of the power of the assembly tended to check the
governor’s prerogative of dissolution and prorogation. In a contest with
Governor Boone, beginning in 1762 and continued to May, 1763, dissolution
and prorogation failed entirely as a means of controlling the actions
or sentiments of the representatives of the people, where the people were
of one mind with the assembly. The subject of dispute involved the
assembly’s sole right to judge of the validity of the election of its own
members, and the argument on the part of the House was conducted
chiefly by Rutledge and Gadsden. But about this time came proposals
that committees from all the colonial assemblies should meet to consider
the British Stamp Act. We conclude this brief narrative with the remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
that in the Continental Congress that ensued the leading statesmen
of the South Carolina popular assembly stepped as veterans to new battlefields
with the dust of recent victories still upon them.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Hawks, in his <i>North Carolina</i>, prints from Thurloe’s <i>State Papers</i> (ii. p. 273) a
letter dated at Linnehaven, in Virginia, May 8, 1654, from Francis Yardley to John Farrar,
giving an account of explorations during the previous year along the seaboard. In 1662
(March) the king granted the first charter, and this was printed the same year, but without

<p>Mr. Fox Bourne, who in his <i>Life of John Locke</i> (London, 1876, vol. i. pp. 235, etc.)
gives the most satisfactory account of Locke’s connection with the new colony, writes of
the Fundamental Constitutions that Locke had a large share in it,
though there can be hardly any doubt that it was initiated by Lord
Ashley, modified by his fellow-proprietors. He adds: “The
original draft, a small vellum-covered volume of seventy-five pages,
neatly written, but with numerous erasures and corrections, is preserved among the
Shaftesbury Papers (series viii. no. 3), and this interesting document has been printed,
<i>verbatim et literatim</i>, by Mr. Sainsbury, in the Appendix to the <i>Thirty-third report of
the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records</i> (1872), pp. 258-269.”</p>

<p>The same author refers to a draft extant in Locke’s handwriting, dated 21 June, 1669,
which varies in some respects from that later issued by the Proprietors, in print.</p>

<p>There is, or was, in 1845, in the Charleston Library, presented to it by Robert Gilmor,
of Baltimore, in 1833, a MS. copy in Locke’s own handwriting, dated July 14, 1669; but
the earliest printed copy is one entitled thus: <i>The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina,
in number a Hundred and Twenty, agreed upon by the Palatine and Lords Proprietors,
to remain the sacred and unalterable form and rule of government of Carolina
forever</i>. <i>March 1, 1669.</i><a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> Printed first in 1670, the document was reissued, with some

<p>It would seem from a map which is given in fac-simile in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, December, 1883 (p. 402), that it describes the “Discovery
made by William Hilton of Charles Towne in New England, Marriner, from Cape Hatteraske,
Lat: 35° 30′, to the west of Cape Roman in Lat. 32° 30′, In y<sup>e</sup> yeare 1662, And laid
down in the forme as you see by Nicholas Shapley of the town aforesaid, November,
1662.” A small sketch of the map, which is annexed, shows that he passed along the
islands which form a barrier to Pamlico Sound, without noticing, or at least indicating,
that interior water, and then entering Cape Fear River tracked its shores up to a point
where he designated three branches, which he called East, North, and West. The fac-simile
given in the <i>Proceedings</i> by Mr. Hassam, from a photograph of the original in
the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> is too obscure to make out all the names which occur along
the river, while only “Hatterask” and “C. Romana”
are noted on the coast. The intervening
points, Cape Lookout and Cape Fear, are not
named.</p>

<p>Hilton had come to Plymouth (Mass.) while
a child, in 1623, whence he followed his father
to Piscataqua, but later settled in Newbury and
Charlestown, and in the latter place he died in
1675. Shapley is supposed to have been the
same who was clerk of the writs in Charlestown
in 1662, dying in that town in May, 1663.
Although the New England antiquary, James
Savage, and others have not supposed this Massachusetts
Hilton to have been the same who
led the Barbadoes party to Cape Fear the next
year, this map and its record would seem to
indicate that when the merchants of that island
determined to accept the proposals of the Proprietors of Carolina to furnish them with
colonists, they placed the expedition which they sent out in August, 1663, under the
charge of one who had already explored parts of this coast,&mdash;no other than this William
Hilton of New England. This exploring party landed at St. Helena and Edisto, and
returned to Barbadoes after an absence of five months. Hilton’s <i>True Relation</i> was
published in London in 1664.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

for the encouragement of settlers within their grant, and we have, as Mr. Rivers has
stated, the outcome of the Sandford expedition (1665) preserved in a manuscript among
the Shaftesbury Papers, and the results of this seem to have been embodied in what
is considered a second and expanded edition of their original proposals, which was now
published in London, in 1666,&mdash;a mere tract of twelve pages, called <i>A brief description

Carolina coast since it was first explored, Mr.
Wm. L. Welsh (<i>Bulletin Essex Institute</i>, xvii.
nos. 1, 2, and 3, and separately Salem, 1885), in
a paper called <i>An Account of the cutting through
of Hatteras Inlet, Sept. 7, 1846</i>, says that the
present inlet of that name was made by the
storm of that date, and that the explorers of
1584 entered through Caffey inlet, since disappeared,
and that all the inlets of that day are
closed, except the little-used Ocracoke inlet.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was under the incentive of Sandford’s explorations and this districting of the country
that the Proprietors entered upon
the expedition which reached the Ashley
River in 1670, for whose guidance Locke
had prepared his plan of government.
The more common knowledge of the
geography of the Carolina coast at this
time is seen in the map of North Carolina
in Ogilby’s <i>America</i> (1671), which is reproduced
in Hawks’ <i>North Carolina</i> (ii.
p. 53).</p>

<p>In 1671 Sir Peter Colleton wrote to
Locke that Ogilby was printing a “Relation
of the West Indies,” and desired
a map of Carolina, and asked Locke to
get the drafts of Cape Fear and Albemarle
from “my lord,” and suggest to him also
“to draw up a discourse to be added to this
map, in the nature of a description such
as might invite people without seeming to
come from us, as would very much conduce
to the speedy settlement.” There
remains, in Locke’s handwriting, a list of
books to be consulted for this task, but
otherwise he does not seem to have done
anything to produce such a description.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another explorer had approached
this region from the north, entering
a country which no European had
visited since the incursions of Lane’s company in the preceding century. We have record
of this expedition in a tract of the following title: <i>The discoveries of John Lederer
in three several marches from Virginia to the west of Carolina, March, 1669-Sept., 1670</i>.
<i>Collected out of the latine from his discourse and writings by Sir William Talbot.</i> London,

<p>Lederer was a German, and was sent out by Governor Berkeley, of Virginia. He
seems to have penetrated westward “to the top of the Apalatœan mountains.” He announced
his disbelief in the views of such as held the distance from the Atlantic to the
Pacific to be but eight or ten days’ journey, as shown in the “Mapp of Virginia discovered
to the Hills,”<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> but was nevertheless inclined to believe that the Indian ocean may
indeed stretch an arm into the continent as far as the Appalachian range.</p>

<p>It was on the second of Lederer’s expeditions, going west and southwest from the
falls of the James, that he extended his course into North Carolina, and Hawks has endeavored
to trace his track. Following him by his names of places, as Ogilby adopted
them in his map of 1671, Lederer would appear to have traversed the breadth of South
Carolina. “We cannot believe this,” says Dr. Hawks. “The time occupied would not
have been sufficient for it. Lederer’s itinerary presents difficulties which we confess we
cannot satisfactorily solve.” It seems at least certain that Lederer did not penetrate
far enough to encounter the new-comers who were about founding the commonwealth
of Locke.</p>

<p>The earliest account which we have of the English settlers at Port Royal, before their
removal to the west bank of the Ashley River, is in Thomas Ash’s <i>Carolina, or a description
of the present state of that country</i>. London, 1682. The author was clerk on board
his majesty’s ship “Richmond,” which was on the coast 1680-82, “with instructions to
enquire into the state of the country.”<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p>During the next few years several brief accounts of the new settlements were printed
which deserve to be named: Samuel Wilson’s anonymous <i>Account of the Province of
Carolina in America; together with an abstract of the Patent and several other necessary
and useful particulars, to such as have thoughts of transporting themselves thither</i>.

<p>The first edition of Blome’s <i>Present state of his majesty’s isles and territories in America</i>,
London, 1687,<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> gave “A new map of Carolina by Robert Morden” (p. 150), and
through translations it became a popular book throughout Europe, and did something to
bring the new colony to their attention.</p>

<p>Courtenay, in the <i>Charleston Year Book</i>, 1883, p. 377, gives a fac-simile of a map (with
a corner map of Charlestown and vicinity) which marks the lots of settlers, and is thought
by him to be earlier than 1700.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>For the next fifteen years there is little in print about the history of Carolina; but not
long after 1700, the attempt of the High-Church party, led by Nicholas Trott, the chief

results.</p>

<p>The establishment of the “Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,”
which had been chartered June 16, 1701, had given a certain impulse to the movement;
and the society had its historiographer in David Humphreys, who in 1730 published at
London his <i>Historical Account</i><a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> of it. This and the abstracts of the early reports of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>

colonies.</p>

<p>The first Episcopal church had been built in Charlestown about 1681-2, and its history
and that of those later founded in the province, as well as of the movement at this time
in progress, can be followed in Frederick D. Dalcho’s <i>Historical Account of the Protestant
Episcopal Church in South Carolina, from the First Settlement of the Province to the
War of the Revolution; with Notices of the Present State of the Church in each Parish,
and some Account of the Early Civil History of Carolina never before published</i>. (Charleston,

<p>The early years of the century were distinguished by the sharp retaliatory attacks
of the Carolinians and the neighboring Spanish. The letter which Colonel Moore sent
to the governor respecting his plundering incursion into Florida is fortunately printed
in the <i>Boston News-Letter</i>, May 1, 1704, whence Carroll copied it for his <i>Hist. Collections</i>
(ii. 573). Of this and of later attacks, we can add something from the <i>Report</i> of the
committee of the South Carolina Assembly, in 1740, on Oglethorpe’s subsequent failure,
and from the narratives of Archdale and Oldmixon, later to be mentioned. Of the
French and Spanish naval attack on Charlestown in 1706,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> Mr. Doyle, in his <i>English
in America</i>, says that the MS. reports preserved in the Colonial Papers confirm the
contemporary account (Sept. 13, 1706) printed in the <i>Boston News-Letter</i>, and the statements
in the <i>Report</i> of 1740 on Oglethorpe’s later defeat at St. Augustine. The <i>News-Letter</i>
account was reprinted in the <i>Carolina Gazette</i>, at a later day.</p>

adds a few details,

Professor Rivers
had earlier contributed
to <i>Russell’s
Mag.</i> (Charleston,
Aug., 1859, p. 458) a paper from the London State Paper Office, entitled “An impartial
narrative of y<sup>e</sup> late invasion of So. Carolina by y<sup>e</sup> French and Spanish in the month of
August, 1706.” Governor John Archdale printed at London, in 1707, <i>A new Description
of that fertile and pleasant province of Carolina, with a brief account of its discovery,
settling, and the government thereof</i> (pp. 32).<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p>The next year (1708) we have an account of the condition of the colony in a letter
signed by Sir Nathaniel Johnson, and dated September
17. It is quoted in large part by Rivers in his
<i>Sketches</i>.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> The name of John Oldmixon (died in England
in 1742) is signed to the dedication of the <i>British
Empire in America</i>, London, 1708, and it passes
under his name. A second corrected and amended edition appeared in 1741.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Herman
Moll made the maps which it contains, including one of Carolina, and some have supposed
that he wrote the text. Dr. Hawks says of the book that it contains almost as
many errors as pages, and unsupported is not to be trusted (ii. p. 481).</p>

<p>In 1708 John Stevens began in London to issue in numbers a work, which when completed
in 1710 and 1711 (copies have both dates) was called <i>A new Collection of Voyages
and Travels into several parts of the world, none of which ever before printed in English</i>.
The second of this series, “printed in the year 1709,” was <i>A new Voyage to Carolina,
containing the exact description and natural history of that country, together with
the present state thereof and a Journal of a thousand miles travel’d thro’ several nations
of Indians, giving a particular account of their customs, manners, etc., by John
Lawson, Gent., Surveyor-General of North Carolina</i>. Other issues of the same sheets,
with new title-pages, are dated 1714 and 1718.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Lawson was a young Englishman, who arrived in Charleston in September, 1700.
After a few months’ tarry in that settlement, he started with five white men and four
Indians, and went by canoe to the Santee, where he turned inland afoot, and as he
journeyed put down what he saw and experienced. In North Carolina he was made
Surveyor-General, and this appointment kept him roaming over the country, during
which he came much in contact with the Indians, and made, as Field says,<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> acute and
trustworthy observations of them. With this life he practised a literary craft, and wrote
out his experiences in a book which was taken to London to be printed,&mdash;an “uncommonly
strong and sprightly book,” as Professor Tyler calls it.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> His vocation of land-surveyor
was not one calculated to endear him to the natives, who saw that the compass
and the chain always harbingered new claims upon their lands. Three years after his
book had been printed he was on a journey (1712) through the wilds with the Baron
de Graffenreid, when the two were seized by the Tuscaroras, who suffered the German
to agree for his release. The Englishman, however, was burned with pine splinters
stuck in his flesh, as is generally believed, though Colonel Byrd, in his <i>History of the
dividing line between Virginia and Carolina</i>, says he was waylaid and his throat cut.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p>Of about this time we also find a number of tracts, incentives to and records of
German and Swiss emigration.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> For the Carey rebellion and the Indian war of 1711,<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>
Hawks used a transcript from an early copy of Governor Spotswood’s letter-book, which
had been in his family and was placed by him in the State Department of North Carolina,
where it had apparently originally belonged. In 1882, the Virginia Historical
Society published the first volume of the Spotswood letters, and the student finds this
material easily accessible now.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p>In 1715 the General Assembly of North Carolina revised and reënacted the body of
statute law then in force,<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> and twelve MS. copies were made, one for each precinct
court. About a quarter of a century ago, says Mr. Swain, the State Historical Agent,
in his <i>Report</i> of 1857, two of these copies, moth-eaten and mutilated, were discovered,
and about 1854 a third copy, likewise imperfect, was found. From these three copies
the body of laws was reconstructed for the State Library.</p>

<p>The authorities for the Yamassee war of 1715-16, so far as printed, are the account
in the <i>Boston News-Letter</i> (June 13, 1715), reprinted in Carroll (ii. 569), where (ii. 141) as
well as in Force’s <i>Tracts</i> (vol. ii.) is one of the chief authorities for this and for that
other struggle which shook off the rule of the Proprietors, published in London in 1726,
under the title of <i>A narrative of the Proceedings of the People of South Carolina in
the year 1719, and of the true causes and motives that induced them to renounce their
obedience to the Lords Proprietors, as their governors, and to put themselves under the
immediate government of the Crown</i>.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> Yonge, who professes to write in this tract from
original papers, is thus made of importance as an authority, since in 1719 the records of
South Carolina seem to have been embezzled, as Rivers infers from an act of February,
1719-20, whose purpose was to recover them “from such as now have the custody
thereof,” and they are not known to exist. We get the passions of the period in <i>The
liberty and property of British subjects asserted: in a letter from an assembly-man in
Carolina to his friend in London</i>. London, 1726.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> It is signed N., and is dated at
Charleston, January 15, 1725, and sustains the discontents, in their criticism of the Proprietary
government. The preface, written in London, gives a history of the colony.</p>

<p>In 1729 all of the Proprietors, except Lord Granville, surrendered their title in the
soil to the Crown;<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> and in 1744 his eighth part was set off to him,<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> being a region sixty-six
miles from north to south, adjoining the southern line of Virginia and running from
sea to sea. Lord Granville retained this title down to the Revolution, and after that
event he endeavored to reëstablish his claim in the Circuit and Supreme Courts, till his
death, during the continuance of the war of 1812, closed proceedings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some sustained efforts were making to induce a Swiss immigration to South
Carolina. Jean Pierre Purry, a leader among them, printed in London in 1724 a tract,
which is very rare: <i>Mémoire presenté à sa Gr. Mylord Duc de Newcastle sur l’état présent
de la Caroline et sur les moyens de l’ameliorer</i>. Londres, 1724.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> In 1880 Colonel
C. C. Jones, Jr., privately printed an English version of it at Augusta, Georgia, as a
<i>Memorial ... upon the present condition of Carolina and the means of its amelioration
by Jean Pierre Purry of Neufchâtel, Switzerland</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> of August, September, and October, 1732, contained an
English rendering of a description of Carolina, drawn up by Purry and others, at Charlestown
in September, 1731. This last paper has been included by Carroll in his <i>Historical
Collections</i> (vol. ii.), and by Force in his <i>Tracts</i> (vol. ii.).<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> Purry’s tracts were in the
interest of immigration, and his and their influence seem to have induced a considerable
number of Swiss to proceed to Carolina, where they formed a settlement called Purrysburg
on the east side of the Savannah River. Hardships, malaria, and unwonted conditions
of life discouraged them, and their settlement was not long continued.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>Bernheim, <i>German Settlements in Carolina</i> (p. 99), points out how the busy distribution
of the rose-colored reports of Purry doubtless also led to the German and Swiss
settlement at Orangeburg, S. C., in 1735, the history of which he derives from the journals
of the council of the province in the state archives, and from those church record-books,
which are preserved. It is to Bernheim we must look for the best accounts of
the other German settlements in different parts of the province.</p>

<p>In 1851 the Lutheran synod of South Carolina put the Rev. G. D. Bernheim in charge
of its records, and in 1858 he began to collect the minutes of the synod of North Carolina,
and to interest himself generally in the history of the German settlements of both
States. From 1861 to 1864 he printed much of the material which he had gathered in
the <i>Southern Lutheran</i>. He found that the writers in English of the histories of the
Carolinas had largely neglected this part of the story, perhaps from unacquaintance with
the tongue in which the records of the early German settlers are written. The settlements
of these people at Newbern and Salem had not indeed been overlooked; but
their plantations in the central and western parts of the State, comprising more than
three fourths of the German population, had been neglected. In the histories of South
Carolina the settlements of Purrysburg and Hard Labor Creek had alone been traced
with attention. In 1872 Mr. Bernheim recast his material into a <i>History of the German
settlements and of the Lutheran church in North and South Carolina, from the earliest
period</i> [to 1850], and published it at Philadelphia. It may be supplemented by a little
volume, <i>The Moravians in North Carolina</i>, by Rev. Levin T. Reichell, Salem, N. C.
1857.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p>We find some assistance in fixing for this period the extent of the domination of the
English Church in a map which accompanies David Humphreys’ <i>Historical Account of
the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts</i>, London, 1730, which is
called “Map of the Province of Carolina, divided into its parishes, according to the latest
accounts, 1730, by H. Moll, geographer.” It has a corner “map of the most improved
parts of [South] Carolina,” which shows the parish churches and the English and Indian
settlements. A fac-simile of this lesser map is annexed. George Howe’s <i>History of
the Presbyterian Church in South Carolina, from 1685 to 1800</i>, Columbia, S. C., 1870, is
another local monograph of interest in the religious development of the province.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>The Huguenot element in Carolina became an important one, and as early as 1737 these
French founded in Charleston the “South Carolina Society,” a benevolent organization,
which in 1837 celebrated its centennial, the memory of which is preserved in a descriptive
pamphlet published at Charleston in that year, containing an oration by J. W.
Toomer, and an appendix of historical documents. There is no considerable account
yet published of these Carolina Huguenots, and the student must content himself with
the scant narrative by Charles Weiss, as given in the translation of his book by H. W.
Herbert, <i>History of the French Protestant Refugees</i> (New York, 1854), which has, in
addition to the narrative in Book iv. on refugees in America, an appendix on American
Huguenots, not, however, very skilfully arranged. There is a similar appendix by G. P.
Disosway<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> at the close of Samuel Smiles’ <i>Huguenots</i> (New York, 1868); and briefer
accounts in Mrs. H. F. S. Lee’s <i>Huguenots in France and America</i> (Cambridge, 1843,
vol. ii. ch. 29), and in Reginald Lane Poole’s <i>History of the Huguenots of the Dispersion</i>
(London, 1880).<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Rivers contributed to <i>Russell’s Magazine</i> (Charleston, Sept., 1859) a paper
on “The Carolina regiment in the expedition against St. Augustine in 1740.”</p>

<p>The natural aspects of the country, as they became better known, we get from Mark
Catesby’s <i>Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands</i>, etc., which
was published in London, from 1732 to 1748, and again in 1754;<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> and a German translation
appeared at Nuremberg in 1755. The English text was revised in the second edition
by Edwards, and again printed at London in 1771.</p>

<p>The files of the early newspapers of the Carolinas afford needful, if scant, material.
Thomas, in his <i>History of Printing</i>, records all there was. The <i>South Carolina Gazette</i>,
beginning in January, 1731-2, was published for little more than a year as a weekly; but
this title was resuscitated in new hands in February, 1734, when the new journal of this
name continued its weekly issues up to the Revolutionary period. No other paper was
begun in that province till 1758, when a new weekly, the <i>South Carolina and American
General Gazette</i>, was started. Three years before this, the first paper had been established
at Newbern, <i>The North Carolina Gazette</i>, which lived for about six years.</p>

<p>To Governor Glen is attributed <i>A description of South Carolina</i>, which was printed in
London in 1761,<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> and is reprinted in Carroll’s <i>Historical Collections</i>, vol. ii. It gives the
civil, natural, and commercial history of the colony. It is the completest survey which
had up to this time been printed.</p>

<p>In the war with the Cherokees some imputations were put upon the South Carolina
rangers, under Henry Middleton, by Grant, the commander of the expeditions against
those Indians; and this charge did not pass unchallenged, as would seem from a tract
published in 1762 at Charleston, entitled <i>Some Observations on the two Campaigns
against the Cherokee Indians in 1760 and 1761</i>.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>For the geography of this period we have two maps in the <i>New and complete History
of the British Empire in America</i>, an anonymous publication which was issued in parts
in London, beginning in 1757. One is a map of Virginia and North Carolina, the other
of South Carolina and Georgia, both stretching their western limits beyond the Mississippi.</p>

<p>At the very end of the period of which we are now writing the MS. description of
South Carolina by the engineer William De Brahm, which is preserved in the library
of Harvard University, becomes of importance for its topographical account, and its
plans and maps, executed with much care. It is included in a volume, containing also
similar descriptions of Georgia and Florida, which portions are noticed in the following
chapter. There are transcripts of this document which have an early date,<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> and some at
least have a title different from the Harvard one, and are called <i>A Philosophico-historico-Hydrography
of South Carolina, Georgia, and East Florida</i>. From such a one, which is
without the drawings, that portion relating to South Carolina was printed in London in
1856, by Mr. Plowden Charles Jennett Weston, in a volume of <i>Documents connected with
the History of South Carolina</i>. An engraved map by De Brahm, <i>Map of South Carolina
and a part of Georgia, composed from surveys taken by Hon. Wm. Bull, Capt. Gascoigne,
Hugh Bryan, and William De Brahm</i>, published in four sheets by Jefferys, also
appeared in the <i>General Topography of North America and the West Indies</i>, London,
1768. The map itself is dated Oct. 20, 1757, and gives tables of names of proprietors of
land in Georgia and Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The earliest account of the history of South Carolina cast in a sustained retrospective
spirit is the anonymous <i>Historical Account of the rise and progress of the Colonies
of South Carolina and Georgia</i> (London, 1779), which is known to have been prepared
by Dr. Alexander Hewatt,&mdash;as his signature seems to fix the spelling of his name,
though in the bibliographical records it appears under various forms.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Carroll, in reprinting
the book in the first volume of his <i>Historical Collections</i>, added many emendatory
notes.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> The next year (1780) produced a far more important book, in respect to
authority, in George Chalmers’ <i>Political Annals of the Present United Colonies, from
their Settlement to the Peace of 1763</i> (London), the first volume of which, however, was
the only one published.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> Chalmers, who was born in 1742, had practised law in Maryland,
but he could not sympathize with the revolution, and at the outbreak returned to
England, where in time (August, 1786) he became the clerk of the Board of Trade and
died in office, May 31, 1825, at the age of eighty-two.</p>

<p>When Williamson was engaged on his <i>History of North Carolina</i> (i. p. 9), he applied
for assistance to Chalmers, whose <i>Political Annals</i> shows that he had access to papers
not otherwise known at that time, but was refused. Grahame, in his <i>Colonial History
of the United States</i> (i. p. xii.), says he got ready access to Chalmers’ papers, but as he
disclosed in his text little new, it was conjectured that before Grahame’s opportunity
much had passed out of Chalmers’ hands. Sparks, in a letter (1856) to Mr. Swain,
the historical agent of North Carolina, says of Chalmers that “he undoubtedly procured
nearly the whole of his materials from the archives of the Board of Trade. His
papers, after having been bound in volumes, were sold by his nephew a few years ago
(1843) in London. I purchased six volumes of them, relating mostly to New England.
They are not important, being memoranda, references, and extracts, used in writing his
<i>Annals</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> Two large volumes of Chalmers’ notes and transcripts also came into the
hands of George Bancroft, and were entrusted by him to the care of Dr. Hawks and
Mr. Rivers, when they were at work upon their histories of North and South Carolina.
Bancroft, from his own use of them, and of Chalmers’ printed <i>Annals</i>, and speaking
particularly of the Culpepper revolution (1678), in the original edition (ii. p. 162) of his
<i>United States</i>, says: “Chalmers’ account in all cases of the kind must be received with
great hesitancy. The coloring is always wrong; the facts usually perverted. He writes
like a lawyer and disappointed politician, not like a calm inquirer. His statements are
copied by Grahame,<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> obscured by Martin, and, strange to say, exaggerated by Williamson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>”
Dr. William Smyth, in his <i>Lectures on Modern History</i>, calls the work of Chalmers
an “immense, heavy, tedious book, to explain the legal history of the different colonies;
it should be consulted in all such points, but it is impossible to read it.”<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>Near the close of the Revolutionary War Chalmers began the printing of another
work, a succinct sketch of the history of the colonies. A very few copies exist of the
first volume, which is without title or preliminary matter, and in the copy before us a blank
leaf contains a manuscript title in Chalmers’ own handwriting as follows: <i>An Introduction
to the History of the Colonies, giving from the State Papers a comprehensive view
of the origin of their Revolt. By George Chalmers, Vol. I. Printed in 1782, But suppressed</i>.
This volume, beginning with the reign of James I. and ending with that of
George I., was the only one printed. The present copy<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> is marked as being the one
from which Mr. Sparks printed an edition published in Boston in 1845,<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> in which the preface
says that the original issue was suppressed, “owing to the separation of the colonies,
which happened just at the season for publication, December, 1782, or the prior
cause in April precedent, the dismission of a tory administration.”<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>When Chalmers’ papers were sold, a manuscript continuation of this <i>Introduction</i> in
the handwriting of the author was found, completely revised and prepared for the press.
When Sparks reprinted the single volume already referred to, he added this second
part to complete the work, and it was carefully carried through the press by John Langdon
Sibley. Sparks in his introductory statements speaks of the book as “deduced for
the most part from the State Papers in the British offices, or to speak with more precision,
from the confidential correspondence of the governors and other officers of the Crown
in the colonies.” In regard to its suppression he adds that “no political ends could
now be answered by its publication, and it is probable that he thought it more politic
to sacrifice the pride and fame of authorship than to run the hazard of offending the
ministers.”<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p class="pc1 mid"><a name="c354" id="c354"></a>NOTE.</p>

<p class="pc1"><span class="smcap">The Later Histories of the Carolinas.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><b>I.</b> <span class="smcap">North Carolina.</span>&mdash;The first published
of the general accounts of this State was the
<i>History of North Carolina</i>, by Hugh Williamson,<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>
at Philadelphia, in 1812, in two volumes.
Dr. Hawks, the later historian, says (ii. p. 540)
that North Carolinians do not recognize Williamson’s
work as a history of their State. It
is inaccurate in a great many particulars, and
sometimes when there is proof that the original
record was lying before him. Sparks calls it
“meagre and unsatisfactory,” and adds that it
contains but few facts, and these apparently the
most unimportant of such as had fallen in his
way.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> More care and discrimination, though
but little literary interest, characterized another
writer. François Xavier Martin had a singular
career. He was born in Marseilles, became a
bankrupt in Martinique, went friendless to Newbern,
in North Carolina, and rose to distinction
as a jurist, after beginning his career in the State
as a translator and vendor of French stories.
He had removed to Louisiana, when he published
at New Orleans his <i>History of North Carolina</i>,
in 1829 (two volumes), and in that State he
rose to be chief justice, and published a history
of it, as we have seen. Martin’s accumulation
of facts carries no advantage by any sort of correlation
except that of dates. A painstaking
search, as far as his opportunities permitted,
and a perspicuous way of writing stand for the
work’s chief merits. He stops at the Declaration
of Independence. Up to Martin’s time Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
might well speak of the carelessness with
which the history of North Carolina had been
written.</p>

<p>Next came John H. Wheeler’s <i>Historical
Sketches of North Carolina from 1584 to 1851,
compiled from original records, official documents,
and traditional statements, with biographical
sketches of her distinguished Statesmen, Jurists,
Lawyers, Soldiers, etc.</i>, Philadelphia, 1851. It is
not unfairly characterized by Mr. C. K. Adams,
in his <i>Manual of Historical Reference</i> (p. 559), as
“a jumble of ill-digested material, rather a collection
of tables, lists, and facts than a history.”</p>

<p>David L. Swain,<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> who had been governor of
the State, had done much to collect transcripts
of documents from the archives of the other
States and from England, and in 1857, as historical
agent of the State, he made a report, which
was printed at Raleigh, in which, speaking of
the statutes at large, which Virginia and South
Carolina had published, he referred to “both of
these collections, especially the former, the earlier
and better work, as deeply interesting in
connection with North Carolina history.”</p>

<p>Of the <i>History of North Carolina</i>, by Francis
Lister Hawks, D. D., LL. D., the second volume,
published at Fayetteville in 1858, covers
the period of the Proprietary government from
1663 to 1729, the first volume being given to the
Raleigh period, etc. He availed himself of the
fullest permission by state and local authorities
to profit by the records within his own State;
and he had earlier himself procured in London
many copies of documents there. The author
claims that more than three fourths of this volume
has been prepared from original authorities,
existing in manuscript. He tells at greater
length than others the story of the law and its
administration, of the industrial and agricultural
arts, navigation and trade, religion and learning.</p>

<p>The latest local treatment is that of Mr. John
W. Moore’s <i>History of North Carolina from the
earliest discoveries to the present time</i>, Raleigh,
1880, in two volumes. There is not much attempt
at original research, and he does not reprint
documentary material, as Hawks did, in too
great profusion to make a popular book. Mr.
Moore aims to give a better literary form to the
story; but his style somewhat overlays his facts.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>II.</b> <span class="smcap">South Carolina.</span>&mdash;To turn to the
more southern province,&mdash;Dr. David Ramsay,
who was a respectable physician from Pennsylvania,
domiciled and married in Charleston,
gained some reputation in his day as a practised
writer, and as an historical scholar of zeal and
judgment. He published first, in 1796, a <i>Sketch
of the Soil, Climate, etc., of South Carolina</i>; and
later, in 1809, at Charleston, a <i>History of South
Carolina</i>, 1670-1808, in which he made good use
of Hewatt, as far as he was available.</p>

<p>In 1836 Carroll republished many of the early
printed tracts upon South Carolina history in
his two volumes of <i>Historical Collections</i>. Referring
to this publication, a writer in the <i>Southern
Quarterly Review</i>, Jan., 1852, p. 185, says:
“But for a timely appropriation by the legislature
of two thousand dollars for his relief, Carroll
would have been seriously the sufferer by
his experiment on public taste and sectional patriotism.”</p>

<p>Grahame in 1836 had published the first edition
of his <i>Colonial History of the United States</i>,
including the early history of the Carolinas, and
Bancroft, in 1837, published the second volume
of his <i>History of the Colonization of the United
States</i>, and in chapter xiii. he discussed how
Shaftesbury and Locke legislated for South Carolina,&mdash;a
chapter considerably changed in his
last edition (1883).</p>

<p>The South Carolina novelist, William G.
Simms, first published a small history of the
State in 1840, which served for school use. This
he revised in 1860 as a <i>History of South Carolina</i>,
which was published in New York. It was
spirited, but too scant of detail for scholarly
service.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>The South Carolina Historical Society was
formed in 1855, Mr. Rivers, the writer of the
preceding chapter, being one of the originators.
The first volume of their <i>Collections</i>, published
in 1857, contained, beside an opening address by
Professor F. A. Porcher, the beginning of a list
and abstracts of papers in the State Paper Office,
London, relating to South Carolina. This enumeration
was continued in the second and third
volumes.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> There are also in the second volume,
beside Petigru’s oration, a paper on the French
Protestants of the Abbeville district, an oration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>by J. B. Cohen, and O. M. Lieber’s vocabulary
of the Catawba language. In vol. iii. we find an
oration by W. H. Trescott. No further volumes
have been printed.</p>

<p>Mr. Rivers’ <i>Sketch of the History of South
Carolina to the Close of the Proprietary Government
by the Revolution of 1719</i>, published in
Charleston in 1856, was continued by him in <i>A
Chapter in the Early History of South Carolina</i>,
published at Charleston in 1874, which largely
consists of explanatory original documents. This
section of a second volume of his careful history
was all that the author had accomplished
towards completing the work, when the civil war
of 1861 “rendered him unable to continue its
preparation.” Mr. Rivers says, in a note in this
supplementary chapter, that an examination of
the records at Columbia has shown him that, to
perfect this additional task, it would be necessary
to make examination among the records
of the State-Paper Office in London.</p>

<p>Of these latter records Mr. Fox Bourne, in
his <i>Life of John Locke</i> (London, 1876), says:
“Locke’s connection with the affairs of the colony
lasted only through its earliest infancy.
Down to the autumn of 1672 he continued his
informal office of secretary to the Proprietors.
Nearly every letter received from the colony is
docketed by him; and of a great number that
have disappeared there exist careful epitomes in
his handwriting. We have also drafts, entered
by him, of numerous letters sent out from England,
and his hand is plainly shown in other letters.
Out of this material it would be easy to
construct almost the entire history of the colony
during the first years of its existence.”</p>

<p>It was some time before the period of Mr.
Fox Bourne’s writing that the Earl of Shaftesbury
deposited with the deputy keeper of the
Public Records the collection of documents
known as the <i>Shaftesbury Papers</i>, the accumulation
which had been formed in the hands of his
ancestor, and which yield so much material for
the early history of the Carolina government.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>The latest use made of these and other papers
of the State-Paper Office is found in <i>The English
in America, Virginia, Maryland, and the
Carolinas</i> (London, 1882), written by Mr. John
A. Doyle, librarian of All Souls, Oxford. In
a note to his chapter on the “Two Carolinas,”
Doyle says (p. 427), respecting the material
for Carolinian history in the English archives:
“To make up for the deficiency of printed authorities,
the English archives are unusually
rich in papers referring to Carolina. There are
letters and instructions from the Proprietors, individually
and collectively, and reports sent to
them by successive governors and other colonial
officials. It is remarkable, however, that while
we have such abundant material of this kind,
there is a great lack of records of the actual
proceedings of the local legislatures in North
and South Carolina. In North Carolina we
have no formal record of legislative proceedings
during the seventeenth century. In South
Carolina they are but few and scanty till after
the overthrow of the Proprietary government.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>
Moreover, the early archives of Carolina, though
abundant, are necessarily somewhat confused.
The northern and southern colonies, while practically
distinct, were under the government of a
single corporation, and thus the documents relating
to each are most inextricably mixed up.
Again, while the Proprietors were the governing
body, the colonies in some measure came under
the supervision of the Lords of Trade and Plantations,
and at a later day of the Board of Trade.
Thus much which concerns the colony is to be
found in the entry books of the latter body,
while the Proprietary documents themselves are
to be found partly among the colonial papers,<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>
partly in a special department containing the
Shaftesbury Papers.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Fifth Report of the Historical Manuscripts
Commission</i> there is a calendar of the
Shelburne Papers, belonging to the Marquis of
Lansdowne, which shows a considerable number
of documents of interest in the history of
Carolina: as, for instance (p. 215), Governor
Barrington’s account of the State of North Carolina,
January 1, 1732-33; Governor Glen’s answers
with respect to inquiries about South Carolina;
an offer (p. 218) of a treaty for the sale
of Lord Granville’s district in North Carolina
to the Crown, signed by the second Lord Granville;
and (p. 228, etc.) various reports of law
officers of the Crown on questions arising in the
government of the colonies.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE ENGLISH COLONIZATION OF GEORGIA.</p>

<p class="pc1">1733-1752.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY CHARLES C. JONES, JR., LL. D.</p>


<p class="drop-cap18">ACTING under the orders of Admiral Coligny, Captain Ribault, before
selecting a location for his fort and planting his Huguenot colony
near the mouth of Port Royal, traversed what is now known as the Georgia
coast, observed its harbors, and named several of the principal rivers
emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> “It was a fayre coast, stretchyng of
a great length, couered with an infinite number of high and fayre trees.”
The waters “were boyling and roaring, through the multitude of all kind
of fish.” The inhabitants were “all naked and of a goodly stature, mightie,
and as well shapen and proportioned of body as any people in ye world;
very gentle, courteous, and of a good nature.” Lovingly entertained were
these strangers by the natives, and they were, in the delightful spring-time,
charmed with all they beheld. As they viewed the country they pronounced
it the “fairest, fruitfullest, and pleasantest of all the world,
abounding in hony, venison, wilde foule, forests, woods of all sorts, Palm-trees,
Cypresse, and Cedars, Bayes ye highest and greatest; with also the
fayrest vines in all the world, with grapes according, which, without natural
art and without man’s helpe or trimming, will grow to toppes of Okes and
other trees that be of a wonderfull greatness and height. And the sight of
the faire medowes is a pleasure not able to be expressed with tongue: full
of Hernes, Curlues, Bitters, Mallards, Egrepths, Wood-cocks, and all other
kinds of small birds; with Harts, Hindes, Buckes, wilde Swine, and all
other kindes of wilde beastes, as we perceiued well, both by their footing
there, and also afterwardes in other places by their crie and roaring in the
night.... Also there be Conies and Hares, Silk Wormes in merueilous
number, a great deale fairer and better than be our silk wormes. To be
short, it is a thing vnspeakable to consider the thinges that bee scene there
and shal be founde more and more in this incomperable lande, which, neuer
yet broken with plough yrons, bringeth forth al things according to his
first nature wherewith the eternall God indued it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Enraptured with the delights of climate, forests, and waters, and transferring
to this new domain names consecrated by pleasant associations at
home, Captain Ribault called the River St. Mary the <i>Seine</i>, the Satilla the
<i>Somme</i>, the Alatamaha the <i>Loire</i>, the Newport the <i>Charante</i>, the Great
Ogeechee the <i>Garonne</i>, and the Savannah the <i>Gironde</i>. Two years afterward,
when René de Laudonnière visited Ribault’s fort, he found it deserted.
The stone pillar inscribed with the arms of France, which he had erected
to mark the farthest confines of Charles IX.’s dominion in the Land of
Flowers, was garlanded with wreaths. Offerings of maize and fruits lay
at its base; and the natives, regarding the structure with awe and veneration,
had elevated it into the dignity of a god.</p>

<p>As yet no permanent lodgment had been effected in the territory subsequently
known as Georgia. The first Europeans who are known to have
traversed it were Hernando de Soto and his companions, whose story has
been told elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> The earliest grant of the lower part of the territory
claimed by England under the discovery of Cabot, was made by His
Majesty King Charles I., in the fifth year of his reign, to Sir Robert Heath,
his attorney-general. In that patent it is called <i>Carolina Florida</i>, and the
designated limits extended from the river Matheo in the thirtieth degree, to
the river Passa Magna in the thirty-sixth degree of north latitude. There
is good reason for the belief that actual possession was taken under this
concession, and that, in the effort to colonize, considerable sums were expended
by the proprietor and by those claiming under him. Whether this
grant was subsequently surrendered, or whether it was vacated and declared
null for <i>non user</i> or other cause, we are not definitely informed. Certain it
is that King Charles II., in the exercise of his royal pleasure, issued to the
Lords Proprietors of Carolina two grants of the same territory with some
slight modifications of boundaries. The latter of these grants, bearing date
the 30th of June in the seventeenth year of his reign, conveys to the Lords
Proprietors that portion of the New World lying between the thirty-sixth
and the twenty-ninth degrees of north latitude. While the English were
engaged in peopling a part of the coast embraced within these specified
limits, the Spaniards contented themselves with confirming their settlements
at St. Augustine and a few adjacent points.</p>

<p>Although in 1670 England and Spain entered into stipulations for
composing their differences in America,&mdash;stipulations which have since
been known as the <i>American Treaty</i>,&mdash;the precise line of separation
between Carolina and Florida was not defined. Between these powers
disputes touching this boundary were not infrequent. In view of this
unsettled condition of affairs, and in order to assert a positive claim to,
and retain possession of, the debatable ground which neither party was
willing either to relinquish or clearly to point out, the English established
and maintained a small military post on the south end of Cumberland
Island, where the river St. Mary empties its waters into the Atlantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Apprehending that either the French or Spanish forces would take
possession of the Alatamaha River, King George I. ordered General
Nicholson, then governor of Carolina, with a company of one hundred
men, to secure that river, as being within the bounds of South Carolina;
and, at some suitable point, to erect a fort with an eye to the protection
of His Majesty’s possessions in that quarter and the control of the navigation
of that stream. That fort was placed near the confluence of the
Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers, and was named Fort George.</p>

<p>Although by the treaty of Seville commissioners were appointed to
determine the northern boundary line of Florida, which should form the
southern limit of South Carolina, no definite conclusion was reached, and
the question remained open and a cause of quarrel until the peace of 1763,
when Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain.</p>

<p>In recalling the instances of temporary occupancy, by Europeans, of
limited portions of the territory at a later period conveyed to the trustees
for establishing the Colony of Georgia, we should not omit an allusion
to the mining operations conducted by the Spaniards at an early epoch
among the auriferous mountains of upper Georgia. Influenced by the
representations made by the returned soldiers of De Soto’s expedition of
the quantity of gold, silver, and pearls in the province of Cosa, Luis de
Velasco dispatched his general, Tristan de Luna, to open communication
with Cosa by the way of Pensacola Bay. Three hundred Spanish soldiers,
equipped with mining tools, penetrated beyond the valley of the Coosa and
passed the summer of 1560 in northern Georgia and the adjacent region.
Juan Pardo was subsequently sent by Aviles, the first governor of Florida,
to establish a fort at the foot of the mountains northwest of St. Augustine
and in the province of the chief Coabá. It would seem, therefore, that the
Spaniards at this early period were acquainted with, and endeavored to
avail themselves of, the gold deposits in Cherokee Georgia.</p>

<p>By the German traveller Johannes Lederer<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> are we advised that these
peoples in 1669 and 1670 were still working gold and silver mines in the
Appalachian mountains; and Mr. James Moore assures us that twenty
years afterward these mining operations were not wholly discontinued.</p>

<p>Thus, long before the advent of the English colonists, had the Spaniards
sojourned, in earnest quest for precious metals, among the valleys and
mountains of the Cherokees. Thus are we enabled to account for those
traces of ancient mining observed and wondered at by the early settlers of
upper Georgia,&mdash;operations of no mean significance, conducted by skilled
hands and with metallic tools,&mdash;which can properly be referred neither to
the Red Race nor to the followers of De Soto.</p>

<p>In June, 1717, Sir Robert Mountgomery secured from the Palatine and
Lords Proprietors of the Province of Carolina a grant and release of all
lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and Savannah, with permission
to form settlements south of the former stream. This territory was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
be erected into a distinct province, “with proper jurisdictions, privileges,
prerogatives, and franchises, independent of and in no manner subject to
the laws of South Carolina.” It was to be holden of the Lords Proprietors
by Sir Robert, his heirs and assigns forever, under the name and title of
the Margravate of Azilia. A yearly quit rent of a penny per acre for all
lands “occupied, taken up, or run out,” was to be paid. Such payment,
however, was not to begin until three years after the arrival of the first
ships transporting colonists. In addition, Sir Robert covenanted to render
to the Lords Proprietors one fourth part of all the gold, silver, and royal
minerals which might be found within the limits of the ceded lands.
Courts of justice were to be organized, and such laws enacted by the
freemen of the Margravate as might conduce to the general good and
in no wise conflict with the statutes and customs of England. The navigation
of the rivers was to be free to all the inhabitants of the colonies of
North and South Carolina. A duty similar to that sanctioned in South
Carolina was to be laid on skins, and this revenue was to be appropriated
to the maintenance of clergy. In consideration of this cession, Sir Robert
engaged to transport at his own cost a considerable number of families, and
all necessaries requisite for the support and comfort of settlers within
the specified limits. It was understood that if settlements were not formed
within three years from the date of the grant, it should become void.</p>

<p>In glowing terms did Sir Robert unfold the attractions of his future Eden
“in the most delightful country of the Universe,” and boldly proclaim “that
Paradise with all her virgin beauties may be modestly supposed at most
but equal to its native excellencies.” After commending in the highest
terms the woods and meadows, mines and odoriferous plants, soil and
climate, fruits and game, streams and hills, flowers and agricultural capabilities,
he exhibited an elaborate plan of the Margravate, in which he did
not propose to satisfy himself “with building here and there a fort,&mdash;the
fatal practice of America,&mdash;but so to dispose the habitations and divisions
of the land that not alone our houses, but whatever we possess, will be
inclosed by <i>military lines</i> impregnable against the <i>savages</i>, and which will
make our whole plantation one continued fortress.”</p>

<p>Despite all efforts to induce immigration into this favored region, at
the expiration of the three years allowed by the concession Sir Robert
found himself without colonists. His grant expired and became void by
the terms of its own limitations. His Azilia remained unpeopled save
by the red men of the forest. His scheme proved utterly Utopian. It
was reserved for Oglethorpe and his companions to wrest from primeval
solitude and to vitalize with the energies of civilization the lands lying
between the Savannah and the Alatamaha.</p>

<p>Persuaded of their inability to afford suitable protection to the colony
of South Carolina, and moved by the wide-spread dissatisfaction existing
in that province, the Lords Proprietors, with the exception of Lord Carteret,
taking advantage of the provisions of an act of Parliament, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
25th of July in the third year of the reign of His Majesty King George II.,
and in consideration of the sum of £22,500, surrendered to the Crown not
only their rights and interest in the government of Carolina, but also their
ownership of the soil. The outstanding eighth interest owned by Lord
Carteret, Baron of Hawnes, was by him, on the 28th of February, 1732,
conveyed to the “Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in
America.”</p>

<p>The scheme which culminated in planting a colony on the right bank
of the Savannah River at Yamacraw Bluff originated with James Edward
Oglethorpe, a member of the English House of Commons, and “a gentleman
of unblemished character, brave, generous, and humane.” He was
the third son of Sir Theophilus, and the family of Oglethorpe was ancient
and of high repute.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> Although at an early age a matriculate of Corpus
Christi College, Oxford, he soon quitted the benches of that venerable
institution of learning for an active military life. With him a love of arms
was an inheritance, for his father attained the rank of major-general in
the British service, and held the office of first equerry to James II., who
intrusted him with an important command in the army assembled to oppose
the Prince of Orange. Entering the English army as an ensign in
1710, young Oglethorpe continued in service until peace was proclaimed
in 1713. The following year he became captain-lieutenant of the first troop
of the Queen’s Life-Guards. Preferring active employment abroad to an
idle life at home, he soon repaired to the continent that he might perfect
himself in the art of war under the famous Prince Eugene of Savoy, who,
upon the recommendation of John, Duke of Argyle, gave him an appointment
upon his staff, at first as secretary and afterward as aid-de-camp. It
was a brave school, and his alertness, fidelity, and fearlessness secured for
him the good-will, the confidence, and the commendation of his illustrious
commander. Upon the conclusion of the peace of 1718 Oglethorpe returned
to England, versed in the principles of military science, accustomed
to command, inured to the shock of arms, instructed in the orders of battle,
the management of sieges and the conduct of campaigns, and possessing a
reputation for manhood, executive ability, and warlike knowledge not often
acquired by one of his years. His brother Theophilus dying, he succeeded
to the family estate at Westbrook, and in October, 1732, was elected
a member for Haslemere in the county of Surrey. This venerable borough
and market-town he continued to represent, through various changes of
administration, for two-and-thirty years.</p>

</div></div>

<p>While he was chairman of the committee raised by the House of Commons
to visit the prisons, examine into the condition of the inmates, and suggest
measures of reform, the idea had occurred to Oglethorpe,&mdash;whose “strong
benevolence of soul” has been eulogized by Pope,&mdash;that not a few of
these unfortunate individuals confined for debt, of respectable connections,
guilty of no crime, and the victims of a legal thraldom most vile and afflictive,
might be greatly benefited by compromising the claims for the non-payment
of which they were suffering the penalty of hopeless incarceration,
upon the condition that when liberated they would become colonists in
America. Thus would opportunity be afforded them of retrieving their
fortunes; thus would England be relieved of the shame and the expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
of their imprisonment, and thus would her dominion in the New World be
enlarged and confirmed. Not the depraved, not felons who awaited the
approach of darker days when graver sentences were to be endured, not
the dishonest who hoped by submitting to temporary imprisonment to
exhaust the patience of creditors and emerge with fraudulently acquired
gains still concealed, but the honestly unfortunate were to be the beneficiaries
of this benevolent and patriotic scheme. Those also in the United
Kingdom who through want of occupation and lack of means were most
exposed to the penalties of poverty, were to be influenced in behalf of the
contemplated colonization. It was believed that others, energetic, ambitious
of preferment, and possessing some means, could be enlisted in aid of
the enterprise. The anxiety of the Carolinians for the establishment of a
plantation to the South which would serve as a shield against the incursions
of the Spaniards, the attacks of the Indians, and the depredations of fugitive
slaves was great. This scheme of colonization soon embraced within
its benevolent designs not only the unfortunate of Great Britain, but also
the oppressed and persecuted Protestants of Europe. Charity for, and the
relief of, human distress were to be inscribed upon the foundations of the
dwellings which Oglethorpe proposed to erect amid the Southern forests.
Their walls were to be advanced bulwarks for the protection of the Carolina
plantations, and their aspiring roofs were to proclaim the honor and the
dominion of the British nation. In the whole affair there lingered no hope
of personal gain, no ambition of a sordid character, no secret reservation
of private benefit. The entire project was open, disinterested, charitable,
loyal, and patriotic. Such was its distinguishing peculiarity. Thus was it
recognized by all; and Robert Southey did but echo the general sentiment
when he affirmed that no colony was ever projected or established upon
principles more honorable to its founders.</p>

<p>As the accomplishment of his purpose demanded a larger expenditure
than his means justified, and as the administration of the affairs of the
plantation would involve “a broader basis of managing power” than a
single individual could well maintain, Oglethorpe sought and secured the
co-operation of wealthy and influential personages in the development of
his beneficent enterprise.</p>

<p>That proper authority, ample cession, and royal sanction might be
obtained, in association with Lord Percival and other noblemen and gentlemen
of repute he addressed a memorial to the Privy Council, in which,
among other things, it was stated that the cities of London and Westminster,
and the adjacent region, abounded with indigent persons so
reduced in circumstances as to become burdensome to the public, who
would willingly seek a livelihood in any of His Majesty’s plantations in
America if they were provided with transportation and the means of settling
there. In behalf of themselves and their associates the petitioners engaged,
without pecuniary recompense, to take charge of the colonization, and to
erect the plantation into a proprietary government, if the Crown would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
pleased to grant them lands lying south of the Savannah River, empower
them to receive and administer all contributions and benefactions which
they might influence in encouragement of so good a design, and clothe
them with authority suitable for the enforcement of law and order within
the limits of the province. After the customary reference, this petition met
with a favorable report, and by His Majesty’s direction a charter was prepared
which received the royal sanction on the 9th of June, 1732.</p>

<p>By this charter, Lord John, Viscount Percival, Edward Digby, George
Carpenter, James Oglethorpe, George Heathcote, Thomas Tower, Robert
Moor, Robert Hucks, Roger Holland, William Sloper, Francis Eyles, John
Laroche, James Vernon, William Beletha, John Burton, Richard Bundy,
Arthur Beaford, Samuel Smith, Adam Anderson, and Thomas Coram and
their successors were constituted a body politic and corporate by the name of
“The Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in America.” Ample
were the powers with which this corporation was vested. Seven eighths “of
all those lands lying and being in that part of South Carolina in America
which lies from the most northern part of a stream or river there commonly
called the Savannah, all along the sea-coast to the southward unto the most
southern stream of a certain other great water or river called the Alatamaha,
and westerly from the heads of the said rivers respectively in direct
lines to the South Seas,” were conveyed to the trustees for the purposes
of the plantation. The province was named Georgia, and was declared
separate and distinct from South Carolina. To all, save Papists, was accorded
a free exercise of religious thought and worship. For a period of
twenty-one years were these corporators and their successors authorized
to administer the affairs of the province. At the expiration of that time
it was provided that such form of government would then be adopted, and
such laws promulgated for the regulation of the colony and the observance
of its inhabitants, as the Crown should ordain. Thereafter the governor of
the province and all its officers, civil and military, were to be nominated
and commissioned by the home government.</p>

<p>In July, 1732, the corporators convened, accepted the charter, and
perfected an organization in accordance with its provisions.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> Commissions
were issued to leading citizens and charitable corporations empowering
them to solicit contributions in aid of the trust. Generously did the Trustees
subscribe. To prevent any misappropriation of funds, an account was
opened with the Bank of England. There a register was kept of the names
of all benefactors and of the amounts of their several donations. Liberal
responses were received in furtherance of the charitable scheme both from
individuals and from corporations; and, as an honorable indorsement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
project and its managers, Parliament gave the sum of £10,000. Tracts
commending the colonization to the favorable notice of the public were
prepared,&mdash;notably by Oglethorpe, and by Benjamin Martyn, secretary to
the Trustees,&mdash;and widely circulated.</p>

<p>In framing regulations for the observance of the colonists, and in maturing
plans most conducive to the prosperity and permanence of the
contemplated settlement, the trustees regarded each male inhabitant both
as a planter and as a soldier. Hence, provision was made for supplying
him with arms and with agricultural tools. Towns, in their inception, were
reckoned as garrisons. Consequently the lands allotted for tillage were to
be in their immediate neighborhood, so that in seasons of alarm the inhabitants
might speedily betake themselves thither for safety and mutual protection.
Fifty acres were adjudged sufficient for the support of a planter
and his family. Grants in tail-male were declared preferable to any other
tenure. The introduction and use of spirituous liquors were forbidden.
Unless sanctioned by special license, traffic with the natives was prohibited.
The trustees saw fit also to forbid the importation, ownership, and use of
negro slaves within the limits of the province of Georgia. Provision was
made for the cultivation of the mulberry tree and the breeding of silk-worms.</p>

<p>Keeping in view the benevolent objects of the association and the
character of the settlement to be formed, it was manifest that only fit
persons should be selected for colonization, and that due care should be
exercised in the choice of emigrants. Preference was accordingly given to
applicants who came well recommended by the ministers, church-wardens,
and overseers of their respective parishes. That the Trustees might not be
deceived in the characters and antecedents of those who signified a desire
to avail themselves of the benefits of the charity, a committee was appointed
to visit the prisons and examine the applicants there confined. If they
were found to be worthy, compromises were effected with their creditors
and consents procured for their discharge. Another committee sat at the
office of the corporation to inquire into the circumstances and qualifications
of such as there presented themselves. It has been idly charged that in
the beginning Georgia colonists were impecunious, lawless, depraved, and
abandoned; that the settlement at Savannah was a sort of Botany Bay,
and that Yamacraw Bluff was peopled by runagates from justice. The
suggestion is without foundation. The truth is that no applicant was
admitted to the privilege of enrolment as an emigrant until he had been
subjected to a preliminary examination, and had furnished satisfactory
evidence that he was fairly entitled to the benefits of the charity. Other
American colonies were founded and augmented by individuals coming at
will, without question for personal gain, and furnishing no certificate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
either past or present good conduct. Georgia, on the contrary, exhibits
the spectacle, at once unique and admirable, of permitting no one to enter
her borders who was not, by competent authority, adjudged worthy the
rights of citizenship. Even those colonists who proposed to come at their
own charge, and who brought servants with them, were required, as a condition
precedent to their embarkation, to prove that they had obtained
permission from the committee selected by the Trustees to pass upon the
qualification of applicants. Upon receiving the approbation of the committee,
and until the time fixed for sailing, adult male emigrants passing
under the bounty of the Trust were drilled each day by the sergeants of
the Royal Guards.</p>

<p>By the 3d of October, 1732, one hundred and fourteen individuals&mdash;comprising
men, women, and children&mdash;had been enrolled for the first embarkation.
The “Anne,” a galley of some two hundred tons burden, commanded
by Captain Thomas, was chartered to convey them to Georgia. She was
furnished not only with necessaries for the voyage, but also with arms,
agricultural implements, tools, munitions, and stores for the use and support
of the colonists after their arrival in America. At his own request,
Oglethorpe was selected to conduct the colonists and establish them in
Georgia. He volunteered to bear his own expenses, and to devote his
entire time and attention to the consummation of the important enterprise.
Himself the originator and the most zealous advocate of the scheme,&mdash;this
offer on his part placed the seal of consecration upon his self-denial,
patriotism, and enlarged philanthropy. Most fortunate were the Trustees
in securing the services of such a representative. To no one could the
power to exercise the functions of a colonial governor have been more
appropriately confided.</p>

<p>On the 17th of November, 1732, the “Anne” departed from England,
having on board about one hundred and thirty persons. Thirty-five families
were represented. Among them were carpenters, brick-layers, farmers,
and mechanics, all able-bodied and of good repute. Shaping her course
for the island of Madeira, the vessel there touched and took on board five
tuns of wine. After a protracted voyage the “Anne” dropped anchor off
Charlestown bar on the 13th of January, 1733. Two delicate children had
died at sea. With this exception, no sorrow darkened the passage, and
the colonists were well and happy.</p>

<p>Oglethorpe was warmly welcomed and hospitably entreated by the
governor and council of South Carolina. The King’s pilot was detailed to
conduct the “Anne” into Port Royal harbor. Thence the colonists were
conveyed in small craft to Beaufort-town, where they landed and refreshed
themselves; while their leader, accompanied by Colonel William Bull,
proceeded to the Savannah River and made choice of a spot for the
settlement. Ascending that stream as far as Yamacraw Bluff, and deeming
it an eligible situation, he went on shore and marked out the site of a town
which, from the river flowing by, he named Savannah. This bluff, rising
some forty feet above the level of the river, and presenting a bold frontage
on the water of nearly a mile,&mdash;quite ample for the riparian uses of a settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
of considerable magnitude,&mdash;was the first high ground abutting
upon the stream encountered by him in its ascent. To the south a high
and dry plain, overshadowed by pines interspersed with live-oaks and magnolias,
stretched away for a mile or more. On the east and west were
small creeks and swamps affording convenient drainage for the intermediate
territory. The river in front was capable of floating ships of ordinary
tonnage, and they could lie so near the shore that their cargoes might
with facility be discharged. Northwardly, in the direction of Carolina, lay
the rich delta of the river, with its islands and lowlands crowned with a
dense growth of cypress, sweet-gum, tupelo, and other trees, many of them
vine-covered and draped in long gray moss swaying gracefully in the
ambient air. The yellow jessamine was already mingling its delicious perfume
with the breath of the pine, and the forest was vocal with the voices
of singing birds. Everything in this semi-tropical region was quickening
into life and beauty under the influences of returning spring. In
its primeval repose it seemed a goodly land. The temperate rays of the
sun gave no token of the heat of summer. There was no promise of
the tornado and the thunder-storm in the gentle winds. In the balmy air
lurked no suspicion of malarial fevers. Its proximity to the mouth of the
river rendered this spot suitable alike for commercial purposes and for
maintaining easy communication with the Carolina settlements.</p>

<p>Near by was an Indian village peopled by the Yamacraws, whose chief,
or mico, was the venerable Tomo-chi-chi. Having, through the intervention
of Mary Musgrove,&mdash;a half-breed, and the wife of a Carolina trader
who had there established a post,&mdash;persuaded the natives of the friendly
intentions of the English and secured from them an informal cession of the
desired lands, Oglethorpe returned to Beaufort. Thence, on the 30th
of January, 1733, the colonists, conveyed in a sloop of seventy tons and
in five periaguas, set sail for Yamacraw Bluff, where, on the afternoon
of the second day afterward, they arrived in safety and passed their first
night upon the soil of Georgia. The ocean had been crossed, and the
germ of a new colony was planted in America. Sharing the privations
and the labors of his companions, Oglethorpe was present planning, supervising,
and encouraging. In marking out the squares, lots, and streets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Savannah, he was materially assisted by Colonel William Bull. Early and
acceptable aid was extended by the authorities of Carolina, and this was
generously supplemented by private benefactions. Well knowing that
the planting of this colony would essentially promote the security of Carolina,
shielding that province from the direct assaults and machinations
of the Spaniards in Florida, preventing the ready escape of fugitive slaves,
guarding her southern borders from the incursions of Indians, increasing
commercial relations, and enhancing the value of lands, the South Carolinians
were eager to further the prosperity of Georgia. Sensible of the
courtesies and assistance extended, Oglethorpe repaired at an early day
to Charlestown to return thanks in behalf of the colony and to interest
the public still more in the development of the plantation. In this mission
he was eminently successful. He was cheered also by congratulations and
proffers of aid from other American colonies.</p>

<p>In nothing were the prudence, wisdom, skill, and ability of the founder
of the colony of Georgia more conspicuous than in his conduct toward
and treatment of the Indians. The ascendency he acquired over them,
the respect they entertained for him, and the manly, generous, and just
policy he ever maintained in his intercourse with the native tribes of the
region are remarkable. Their favor at the outset was essential to the
repose of the settlement; their friendship, necessary to its existence.
As claimants of the soil by virtue of prior occupancy, it was important
that the title they asserted to these their hunting grounds should at an
early moment be peaceably and formally extinguished. Ascertaining from
Tomo-chi-chi the names and abodes of the most influential chiefs dwelling
within the territory ceded by the charter, Oglethorpe enlisted the good
offices of this mico in calling a convention of them at Savannah. In May,
1733, the Indians assembled, and on the 21st of that month a treaty was
solemnized, by which the Creeks ceded to the Trustees all lands lying between
the Savannah and the Alatamaha rivers, from the ocean to the head
of tide-water. In this cession were also embraced the islands on the coast
from Tybee to St. Simon inclusive, with the exception of Ossabau, Sapelo,
and St. Catharine, which were reserved for the purposes of hunting, fishing,
and bathing. A tract of land between Pipe-maker’s Bluffs and Pally-Chuckola
Creek was also retained as a place of encampment whenever it
should please the natives to visit their white friends at Savannah. Stipulations
were entered into regulating the price of goods, the value of peltry,
and the privileges of traders. It was further agreed that criminal offences
should be tried and punished in accordance with the laws of England.
In due course the provisions of this treaty were formally ratified by the
Trustees.</p>

<p>Thus happily, in the very infancy of the colony, was the title of the
Aborigines to the lands south of the Savannah amicably extinguished.
This treaty compassed the pacification of the Lower Creeks, the Uchees,
the Yamacraws, and of other tribes constituting the Muskhogee confederacy.</p>

<p>Nor did the influences of this convocation rest with them only.
They were recognized by the Upper Creeks; and at a later date similar
stipulations were sanctioned by the Cherokees. For years were they preserved
inviolate; and the colony of Georgia, thus protected, extended its
settlements up the Savannah River and along the coast, experiencing
neither opposition nor molestation, but receiving on every hand valuable
assurance of the good-will of the children of the forest. Probably the
early history of no plantation in America affords so few instances of hostility
on the part of the natives, or so many acts of kindness extended by
the red men. Potent was the influence of Tomo-chi-chi in consummating
this primal treaty of amity and commerce. Had this chief, turning a deaf
ear to the advances of Oglethorpe, refused his friendship, denied his
request, and, inclining his authority to hostile account, instigated a combined
and determined opposition on the part of the Yamacraws, the
Uchees, and the Lower Creeks, the perpetuation of this English settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
would have been either most seriously imperilled or abruptly terminated
amid smoke and carnage. When therefore we recur to the memories of
this period, and as often as the leading events in the early history of the
colony of Georgia are narrated, so often should the favors experienced
at the hands of this mico be gratefully acknowledged. If Oglethorpe’s
proudest claim to the honor and respect of succeeding generations
rests upon the fact that he was the founder of the colony of Georgia, let
it not be forgotten that in the hour of supreme doubt and danger the right
arm of this son of the forest, his active intervention, and his unswerving
friendship were among the surest guarantees of the safety and the very
existence of that province. Tomo-chi-chi will be remembered as the firm
ally of the white man, the guide and protector of the colonist, the constant
companion and faithful confederate of Oglethorpe.</p>

<p>Accessions occurred as rapidly as the means of the Trust would allow.
Among some of the early comers were Italians from Piedmont, who were
engaged to develop the silk industry, from the pursuit of which considerable
gain was anticipated. As the immigrants multiplied, and the defences
at Savannah were strengthened, Fort Argyle was built on the Great Ogeechee
River, the villages of Highgate and Hampstead were laid out, Thunderbolt
and Skidoway Island were occupied, Joseph’s Town and Abercorn
were peopled, and plantations formed on Augustine Creek, on the Little
Ogeechee, and as far south as the Great Ogeechee River. On the 7th of
July, 1733, occurred a general allotment of town lots, garden lots, and
farms among the inhabitants of Savannah; and this was confirmed by
deed executed on the 21st of the following December. The town lot
contained sixty feet in front and ninety feet in depth; the garden lot embraced
five acres. Forty-four acres and one hundred and forty-one poles
constituted the farm; so that the grant aggregated fifty acres,&mdash;thus conforming
to the instructions of the Trustees, and furnishing land sufficient
for the support of the colonist who came at the charge of the Trust and
brought no servants. The conveyance was in tail-male. Of the moneys
realized from the sale of lands in the island of St. Christopher, the sum
of £10,000 was, in pursuance of a resolution of the House of Commons,
paid over to the “Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in
America,” to be by them applied “towards defraying the charges of carrying
over and settling foreign and other Protestants in said colony.” This
timely relief enabled the Trustees to accomplish a purpose from the
execution of which they had been prevented by a want of funds. In
the administration of the Trust preference had been accorded to English
Protestants seeking homes in the New World. Now, however, they were
justified in enlarging the scope of their charity, because the resolution in
obedience to which this liberal benefaction was made, contemplated in
terms the colonization of foreign Protestants.</p>

<p>As the first fruits of this expanded charity, on <i>Reminiscere Sunday</i>,
according to the Lutheran Calendar, in March, 1734, the ship “Purisburg”
entered the Savannah River having on board seventy-eight Salzburgers
under the conduct of Baron von Reck, and accompanied by their
spiritual advisers the Rev. John Martin Bolzius and the Rev. Israel Christian
Gronau. They came from the town of Berchtolsgaden and its vicinity,
had taken the oath of loyalty to the British Crown, and were conveyed
at the charge of the Trust. “Lying in fine and calm weather under the
Shore of our beloved <i>Georgia</i>, where we heard the Birds sing melodiously,
every Body in the Ship was joyful,”&mdash;so wrote the Rev. Mr. Bolzius, the
faithful attendant and religious teacher of this Protestant band. He tells
us that when the ship arrived at the wharf, “almost all the inhabitants
of the Town of Savannah were gather’d together; they fired off some
Cannons and cried Huzzah!... Some of us were immediately fetch’d
on shore in a Boat, and carried about the City, into the woods, and the new
Garden belonging to the Trustees. In the mean time a very good Dinner
was prepared for us.” The inhabitants “shewing them a great deal of
kindness, and the Country pleasing them,” the new-comers “were full
of Joy and praised God for it.”</p>

<p>By the 7th of April all these Salzburgers had been conducted to the
spot designated as their future home. Although sterile and unattractive,
and situated in the midst of a pine barren, to these peoples, tired of the sea
and weary of persecutions, the locality appeared blessed, redolent of sweet
hope, teeming with bright promise, and offering charming repose. The
little town which they built in what is now Effingham County, they called
Ebenezer. Early in the following year this settlement was reinforced by
fifty-seven Salzburgers sent over by the Trustees in the ship “Prince of
Wales.” Accessions occurred from time to time; and thus was introduced
into the colony a population inured to labor, sober, of strong religious convictions,
conservative in thought and conduct, obedient to rulers, and characterized
by intelligent industry. Disappointed in their anticipations with
regard to the fertility of the soil and the convenience of their location, these
peoples, with the consent of Oglethorpe, in a few years abandoned their
abodes and formed a new settlement on the Savannah River near the confluence
of Ebenezer Creek with that stream.</p>

<p>And now the Moravians, accompanied by the Rev. Gottlieb Spangenberg,
sought freedom of religious thought and worship in the province of
Georgia. To them were assigned lands along the line of the Savannah
River between the Salzburgers and the town of Savannah. With the Salzburgers
they associated on terms of the closest friendship. In subduing the
forests, in erecting comfortable dwellings, and in cultivating the soil, they
exhibited a most commendable zeal.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the development of the plantation, desiring a personal
conference with the Trustees, and rightly judging that the advantage and
security of the province would be materially promoted by taking with him
to England some of the most intelligent of his Indian neighbors, that they
might by personal observation acquire a definite conception of the greatness
and the resources of the British empire, and, moved by the kindnesses
and attentions which he was quite sure would be extended to them on
every hand, imbibe memories that would tend to cement the alliances and
perpetuate the amicable relations which had been so auspiciously inaugurated,&mdash;Oglethorpe,
in March, 1734, persuaded Tomo-chi-chi with a selected
retinue to accompany him to London. The reception accorded to these
Indians in the English capital and its environs was cordial and appropriate.
This visit of Tomo-chi-chi and his companions, and the interest
awakened by their presence in London, materially assisted Oglethorpe
and the Trustees in enlisting the renewed and earnest sympathies of the
public, not only in behalf of the colonists, but also in aid of the education
and religious instruction of the natives. Widely disseminated among
the Indian nations was the knowledge of this sojourn of the mico of the
Yamacraws and his companions in the home of the white man. The novel
and beautiful presents which the Indians brought back with them afforded
ocular proof of the liberality of the English, and produced a profound impression
upon the natives, who, grateful for the kindness shown to members
of their race, were encouraged in the perpetuation of the amicable relations
existing between themselves and the colonists.</p>

<p>Through the influence of Oglethorpe the regulations of the Trustees prohibiting
the importation and sale of rum, brandy, and other distilled liquors
within the limits of Georgia, and forbidding the introduction and use of
negro slaves in the province, received the sanction of Parliament. Commenting
upon this legislation, Edmund Burke remarked that while these
restrictions were designed to bring about wholesome results, they were promulgated
without a sufficient appreciation of the nature of the country and
the disposition of the people to be affected by them. Long and earnestly
did many of the colonists petition for the removal of these prohibitions,
which placed the province at a disadvantage when its privileges were
contrasted with those of sister plantations, and beyond doubt, so far at
least as the employment of slave-labor was concerned, retarded its material
development.</p>

<p>The peopling and fortification of the southern confines of Georgia engaged
the earnest thought of the Trustees. The Spaniards regarded with a
jealous eye the confirmation of this new English colony upon the borders
of Florida. Moved by urgent memorials on the subject, Parliament granted
£26,000 for “the settling, fortifying, and defending” Georgia. Their treasury
being thus replenished, and anxious to enlist colonists of acknowledged
strength and valor, the Trustees, through Lieutenant Hugh Mackay,
recruited among the Highlands of Scotland one hundred and thirty men,
with fifty women and children. They were all of excellent character, and
were carefully selected for their military qualities. Accompanied by a
clergyman of their own choice,&mdash;the Rev. John McLeod, of the Isle of
Skye,&mdash;this hardy company was conveyed to Georgia and assigned to
the left bank of the Alatamaha, about sixteen miles above the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
of St. Simon. Here these Highlanders landed, erected a fort, mounted
four pieces of cannon, built a guard-house, a store, and a chapel, and constructed
huts for temporary accommodation preparatory to putting up
more substantial structures. To their little town they gave the name
of New Inverness, and the district which they were to hold and cultivate
they called Darien. These Scots were brave and hardy; just the men to
occupy this advanced post. In their plaids, and with their broadswords,
targets, and fire-arms, they presented a most manly appearance. Previous
to their departure from Savannah in periaguas, some Carolinians endeavored
to dissuade them from going to the south by telling them that the
Spaniards from the houses in their fort would shoot them upon the spot selected
by the Trustees for their abode. Nothing daunted, these doughty
countrymen of Bruce and Wallace responded, “Why, then, we will beat
them out of their fort, and shall have houses ready built to live in.” This
valiant spirit found subsequent expression in the efficient military service
rendered by these Highlanders during the wars between the colonists and the
Spaniards, and by their descendants in the American Revolution. Augmented
at intervals by fresh arrivals from Scotland, this settlement, although
placed in a malarial region, steadily increased in wealth and influence.</p>

<p>At an early date a road was constructed to connect New Inverness with
Savannah.</p>

<p>On the morning of Feb. 5, 1736, the “Symond” and the “London Merchant,”
with the first of the flood, passed over the bar and came to anchor
within Tybee Roads. On board were two hundred and two persons conveyed
on the Trust’s account. Among them were English people, German
Lutherans under the conduct of Baron von Reck and Captain Hermsdorf,
and twenty-five Moravians with their bishop the Rev. David Nitschman.
Oglethorpe was present, accompanied by the brothers John and Charles
Wesley, the Rev. Mr. Ingham, and by Charles Delamotte, the son of a
London merchant and a friend of the Wesleys. Coming at their own
charge were Sir Francis Bathurst, with family and servants, and some relatives
of planters already settled in the province. Ample stores of provisions,
small arms, cannon, ammunition, and tools were transported in these
vessels. The declared object of this large accession of colonists was the
population of the southern confines of the province and the building of a
military town on the island of St. Simon, to be called Frederica.</p>

<p>It was not until the 2d of March that the fleet of periaguas and boats, with
the newly arrived on board, set out from Tybee Roads for the mouth of the
Alatamaha. The voyage to the southward was accomplished in five days.
So diligently did the colonists labor, and so materially were they assisted by
workmen drawn from other parts of the province and from Carolina, that by
the 23d of the month Frederica had been laid out, a battery of cannon commanding
the river had been mounted, and a fort almost completed. Its
ditches had been dug, although not to the required depth or width, and
a rampart raised and covered with sod. A storehouse, having a front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
of sixty feet, and designed to be three stories in height, was finished as to
its cellar and first story. The main street which “went from the Front into
the Country was 25 yards wide. Each Freeholder had 60 Feet in Front by
90 Feet in depth upon the high Street for their House and Garden; but
those which fronted the River had but 30 Feet in Front by 60 Feet in
Depth. Each Family had a Bower of Palmetto Leaves finished upon the
back Street in their own Lands. The Side towards the front Street was set
out for their Houses. These Palmetto Bowers were very convenient shelters,
being tight in the hardest Rains; they were about 20 Feet long and 14 Feet
wide, and in regular Rows looked very pretty, the Palmetto Leaves lying
smooth and handsome, and of a good Colour. The whole appeared something
like a Camp; for the Bowers looked like Tents, only being larger and
covered with Palmetto Leaves instead of Canvas. There were 3 large Tents,
two belonging to Mr. Oglethorpe and one to Mr. Horton, pitched upon
the Parade near the River.” Such is the description of Frederica in its
infancy as furnished by Mr. Moore, whose <i>Voyage to Georgia</i> is perhaps the
most interesting and valuable tract we possess descriptive of the colonization
of the southern portion of Georgia. That there might be no confusion
in their labors, Oglethorpe divided the colonists into working parties. To
some was assigned the duty of cutting forks, poles, and laths for building
the bowers; others set them up; others still gathered palmetto leaves; while
“a fourth gang,” under the superintendence of a Jew workman, bred in
Brazil and skilled in the matter, thatched the roofs “nimbly and in a neat
manner.”</p>

<p>Men accustomed to agriculture instructed the colonists in hoeing and
preparing the soil. Potatoes, Indian corn, flax, hemp-seed, barley, turnips,
lucern-grass, pumpkins, and water-melons were planted. Labor was common,
and inured to the general benefit of the community. As it was
rather too late in the season to till the ground fully and sow a crop to
yield sufficient to subsist the settlement for the current year, many of
the men were put upon pay and set to work upon the fortifications and
the public buildings.</p>

<p>Frederica, situated on the west side of St. Simon’s Island, on a bold bluff
confronting a bay formed by one of the mouths of the Alatamaha River,
was planned as a military town, and constructed with a view to breasting
the shock of hostile assaults. Its houses were to be substantially built,
not of wood as in Savannah, but of tabby. At an early period its streets
by their names proclaimed the presence of men-at-arms, while its esplanade
and parade-ground characterized it as a permanent camp.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> Including
the camp on the north, the parade on the east, and a small wood on the
south which was to serve as a blind in the event of an attack from ships
coming up the river, the settlement was about a mile and a half in circumference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>The town proper was to be protected by embankment and ditch, and
places for two gates, called respectively the Town and Water posts, were
indicated. The citadel was to be made of tabby, and formidably armed.
In front, a water battery, mounting several eighteen-pounder guns, was
designed to command the river. It was contemplated to guard the town
on the land side by a formidable intrenchment, the exterior ditch of which
could be filled with water. As Savannah was intended as the commercial
metropolis of the province, so was Frederica to constitute its southern
outpost and strong defence. It soon became the Thermopylæ of the
southern Anglo-American Colonies, the headquarters of Oglethorpe’s
regiment, the depot of military supplies for the dependent forts built
at the south, and the strong rallying point for British colonization in the
direction of Florida. In the history of the colony there is no brighter
chapter, and in the eventful life of Oglethorpe no more illustrious epoch,
than that which commemorates the protracted and successful struggle with
the Spaniards for the retention of the charming island of St. Simon.
In 1737 Oglethorpe kissed His Majesty’s hand on receiving his commission
as colonel. He was also appointed general and commander-in-chief of
all His Majesty’s forces in South Carolina and Georgia, that he might
the more readily wield the military power of the two provinces in their
common defence.</p>

<p>The finances of the Trust were now in a depressed condition, and the
General was compelled to draw largely upon his private fortune and to
pledge his individual credit in conducting the operations necessary for
the security of the southern frontier, and in provisioning the settlers.
Matters were further complicated by the defalcation of Thomas Causton,
the first Magistrate of Savannah and Keeper of the public stores. Silk
culture, from which so much was anticipated, proved a positive expense.
There was no profit in the vine. Enfeebled by the hot suns of summer,
and afflicted with fevers and fluxes engendered by malarial exhalations
from the marish grounds, many of the inhabitants lost heart and cried
aloud for the introduction of African slavery. Disappointed in their plans
for the religious instruction of the colonists and the conversion of the
natives, the brothers John and Charles Wesley had quitted the province.
In the consummation of his benevolent and educational scheme, the Rev.
George Whitefield was compelled to rely upon foreign aid. With the
exception of the Highlanders at Darien, the Salzburgers at Ebenezer, and
the Indian traders at Augusta, Georgia could not boast that her inhabitants
were either contented or prosperous. There was general clamor for fee-simple
title to lands, and permission to buy slaves was constantly urged.
The disaffected hesitated not to malign the authorities, to disquiet the
settlers, and to exaggerate the unpleasantness of the situation. Fortunately
the Indian nations remained peaceful; and in general convention held at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Coweta-town in August, 1739, in the presence of Oglethorpe, they renewed
their fealty to the King of Great Britain, and in terms most explicit confirmed
their previous grants of territory.</p>

</div>

<p>And now the Spanish war-cloud which had so long threatened the
southern confines of the province, seemed about to descend in wrath
and power. Acting under the discretionary powers confided to him,
General Oglethorpe resolved to anticipate the event by an invasion of
Florida and the reduction of St. Augustine,&mdash;the stronghold of Spanish
dominion in that province.</p>

<p>Collecting his regiment, summoning to his
assistance forces from South Carolina, and calling in his Indian allies, in
May, 1740, with a mixed army of rather more than two thousand men,
he moved upon the capital of Florida. In this expedition Sir Yelverton
Peyton, with the British vessels of war,&mdash;the “Flamborough,” the “Phœnix,”
the “Squirrel,” the “Tartar,” the “Spence,” and the “Wolf,”&mdash;was to participate.
The castle of St. Augustine consisted of a fort built of soft stone.
Its curtain was sixty yards in length, its parapet nine feet thick, and its
rampart twenty feet high, “casemated underneath for lodgings, and arched
over and newly made bombproof.” Its armament consisted of fifty cannon,
sixteen of brass, and among them some twenty-four pounders. For some
time had the garrison been working upon a covered way, but this was still
in an unfinished condition. The town was protected by a line of intrenchments,
with ten salient angles, in each of which field-pieces were mounted.
In January, 1740, the Spanish forces in Florida, exclusive of Indians and
one company of militia, were estimated at nine hundred and sixty-five men
of all arms. As foreshadowed in his dispatch of the 27th of March, 1740,
it was the intention of General Oglethorpe to advance directly upon St.
Augustine, and attack by sea and land the town and the island in its front.
Both, he believed, could be taken “sword in hand.” Conceiving that the
castle would be too small to afford convenient shelter for the two thousand
one hundred men, women, and children of the town, he regarded the
capitulation of the fortress as not improbable. Should it refuse to surrender,
he proposed to shower upon it “Granado-shells from the Coehorns
and Mortars,” and other projectiles. If it should not yield under the bombardment,
he was resolved to open trenches and reduce it by a regular
siege. The result was a disastrous failure. This miscarriage may be
fairly attributed,&mdash;first, to the delay in inaugurating the movement, caused
mainly, if not entirely, by the tardiness on the part of the South Carolina
authorities in contributing the troops, munitions, and provisions for which
requisition had been made; in the second place, to the reinforcement of
men and supplies from Havana introduced into St. Augustine just before
the English expedition set out, thereby repairing the inequality previously
existing between the opposing forces; again, to the injudicious movements
against Forts Francis de Papa and Diego, which put the Spaniards upon the
alert, encouraged concentration on their part, and foreshadowed an immediate
demonstration in force against their stronghold; and to the inability
on the part of the fleet to participate in the assault previously planned, and
which was to have been vigorously undertaken so soon as General Oglethorpe
with his land forces came into position before the walls of St.
Augustine. Finally, the subsequent surprise and destruction of Colonel
Palmer’s command, thereby enabling the enemy to communicate with and
draw supplies from the interior; the lack of heavy ordnance with which to
reduce the castle from the batteries planted on Anastasia island; the impossibility
of bringing up the larger war vessels that they might participate
in the bombardment; the inefficiency of Colonel Vanderdussen’s command;
the impatience and disappointment of the Indian allies, who anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
early capture and liberal spoils; as well as hot suns, heavy dews, a debilitating
climate, sickness among the troops, and the arrival of men, munitions
of war, and provisions from Havana through the Matanzas River,&mdash;all
conspired to render futile whatever hopes at the outset had been
entertained for a successful prosecution of the siege.</p>

<p>Although this attempt&mdash;so formidable in its character when we consider
the limited resources at command, and so full of daring when we contemplate
the circumstances under which it was prosecuted&mdash;resulted in disappointment,
its effects were not without decided advantage to Georgia and
her sister colonies. For two years the Spaniards remained on the defensive.
During that time General Oglethorpe enjoyed an opportunity for
strengthening his fortifications and increasing his army; so that when the
counter blow was delivered by his adversary, he was the better prepared
not only to parry it, but also to punish the uplifted arm.</p>

<p>During the preceding seven years, which constituted the entire life of
the colony, Oglethorpe had enjoyed no respite from his labors. Personally
directing all movements; supervising the location and providing for the
comfort, safety, and good order of the colonists as they arrived from time
to time; reconciling their differences, encouraging and directing their
labors; propitiating the aborigines, influencing necessary supplies, inaugurating
suitable defences, and enforcing the regulations of the Trustees,&mdash;he
had passed constantly from point to point, finding no rest. Upon his
shoulders, as the Trustees’ representative and as a <i>de facto</i> colonial governor,
did the administration of the affairs of the province rest. Now in
tent at Savannah; now in open boat reconnoitring the coast, now upon the
southern islands, his only shelter the wide-spreading live-oak, designating
sites for forts and lookouts, and with his own hands planning military works
and laying out villages; again journeying frequently along the Savannah,
the Great Ogeechee, the Alatamaha, the St. John, and far off into the heart
of the Indian country; often inspecting his advanced posts; undertaking
voyages to Charlestown and to England in behalf of the Trust, and engaged
in severe contests with the Spaniards,&mdash;his life had been one of incessant
activity and solicitude. But for his energy, intelligence, watchfulness, valor,
and self-sacrifice, the important enterprise must have languished. As we
look back upon this period of trial, uncertainty, and poverty, our admiration
for his achievements increases the more closely we scan his limited
resources and opportunities, the more thoroughly we appreciate the difficulties
he was called upon to surmount.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the storm; but the skies were still overcast. In the
distance were heard ominous mutterings portending the advent of another
and a darker tempest. Anxious but calm, Oglethorpe scanned the adverse
skies and prepared to breast their fury. In alluding to the expected invasion
from St. Augustine, he thus writes to the Duke of Newcastle: “If
our men-of-war will not keep them from coming in by sea, and we have
no succor, but decrease daily by different accidents, all we can do will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
to die bravely in His Majesty’s service.... I have often desired assistance
of the men-of-war, and continue to do so. I go on in fortifying this town
[Frederica], making magazines, and doing everything I can to defend the
province vigorously; and I hope my endeavors will be approved of by His
Majesty, since the whole end of my life is to do the duty of a faithful subject
and grateful servant.”</p>

<p>Late in June, 1742, a Spanish fleet of fifty-one sail, with nearly five
thousand troops on board, under the command of Don Manuel de Monteano,
governor of St. Augustine, bore down upon the Georgia coast with
a view to the capture of the island of St. Simon and the destruction of
the English plantation south of the Savannah. To resist this formidable
descent, General Oglethorpe could oppose only a few small forts, about six
hundred and fifty men, a guard schooner, and some armed sloops. With
a bravery and dash almost beyond comprehension, by strategy most admirable,
Oglethorpe by a masterly disposition of the troops at command,
coupled with the timidity of the invaders and the dissensions which arose
in their ranks, before the middle of July put the entire Spanish army and
navy to flight. This “deliverance of Georgia,” said Whitefield, “is such
as cannot be paralleled but by some instances out of the Old Testament.”
The defeat of so formidable an expedition by such a handful of men was a
matter of astonishment to all. The memory of this defence of St. Simon’s
Island and the southern frontier is one of the proudest in the annals of
Georgia. Never again did the Spaniards attempt to put in execution their
oft-repeated threat to extirpate all the English plantations south of Port-Royal
Sound. Sullenly and with jealous eye did they watch the development
of Georgia, until twenty-one years afterwards all disputes were ended
by the cession of Florida to the Crown of Great Britain. Upon the confirmation
of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle most of the English troops were
withdrawn from the island of St. Simon, and its fortifications soon began to
fall into decay.</p>

<p>Georgia at this time consisted of only two counties, Savannah and
Frederica. In April, 1741, Colonel William Stephens, who for several
years had been acting in the colony as secretary to the Trustees, was by
them appointed president of the county of Savannah. In the administration
of public affairs he was aided by four assistants. As General Oglethorpe,
who was charged with the direction and management of the entire
province, spent most of his time at Frederica, the designation of a presiding
officer for that division of Georgia was regarded as superfluous. Bailiffs
were constituted, whose duty it was, under the immediate supervision of the
General, to attend to the concerns of that county. At Augusta, Captain
Richard Kent acted as “conservator to keep the peace in that town and in
the precincts thereof.” Upon the return of General Oglethorpe to England,
in order to provide for the government of the entire colony the Trustees
decided that the president and assistants who had been appointed for the
county of Savannah should be proclaimed president and assistants for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
whole province, and that the bailiffs at Frederica should be considered
simply as local magistrates. They further advised that the salary of the
recorder at Frederica be raised, and that he correspond regularly with the
president and assistants in Savannah, transmitting to them from time to
time the proceedings of the town court, and rendering an account of such
transactions and occurrences in the southern part of the province as it
might be necessary for them to know. Thus, upon the departure of
General Oglethorpe, the honest-minded and venerable Colonel William
Stephens succeeded to the office of colonial governor. It was during his
administration that the Trustees, influenced by repeated petitions and
anxious to promote the prosperity of the province, removed the restrictions
hitherto existing with regard to the introduction, use, and ownership of
negro slaves, and the importation of rum and other distilled liquors. They
also permitted existing tenures of land “to be enlarged and extended to
an absolute inheritance.”</p>

<p>In bringing about the abrogation of the regulation which forbade the
ownership or employment of negro slaves in Georgia, no two gentlemen
were more influential than the Rev. George Whitefield and the Hon. James
Habersham. The former boldly asserted that the transportation of the
African from his home of barbarism to a Christian land, where he would
be humanely treated and required to perform his share of toil common to
the lot of humanity, was advantageous; while the latter affirmed that the
colony could not prosper without the intervention of slave-labor. Georgia
now enjoyed like privileges with those accorded to the sister American provinces.
Lands could now be held in fee-simple, and the power of alienation
was unrestricted. The ownership and employment of negro slaves were
free to all, and the New England manufacturer could here find an open
market for his rum.</p>

<p>The Trustees had up to this point seriously misinterpreted the capabilities
of the climate and soil of Georgia. Although substantial encouragement
had been afforded to Mr. Amatis, to Jacques Camuse, to the
Salzburgers at Ebenezer, and to others; although copper basins and reeling-machines
had been supplied and a filature erected; although silk-worm
eggs were procured and mulberry trees multiplied,&mdash;silk-culture in Georgia
yielded only a harvest of disappointment. The vine also languished. Olive
trees from Venice, barilla seeds from Spain, the kali from Egypt, and
other exotics obtained at much expense, after a short season withered and
died in the public garden. Hemp and flax, from the cultivation of which
such rich yields were anticipated, never warranted the charter of a single
vessel for their transportation, and indigo did not then commend itself to
public favor. Exportations of lumber were infrequent. Cotton was then
little more than a garden plant, and white laborers could not compete
successfully with Carolina negroes in the production of rice. Up to this
point the battle had been with Nature for life and subsistence. Upon the
stores of the Trust did many long rely for food and clothing. Of trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
there was little, and that was confined to the procurement of necessaries.
With the exception of occasional shipments of copper money for circulation
among the inhabitants, sola bills constituted the chief currency of the
province. Now, however, all restrictions removed, Georgia entered upon a
career of comparative prosperity.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April, 1751, Mr. Henry Parker was appointed president of
the colony in the room of Colonel Stephens, who retired upon a pension
of £80. During his administration the first Provincial Assembly of Georgia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
convened at Savannah. It was composed of sixteen delegates, and was
presided over by Francis Harris. As the privilege of enacting laws was by
the terms of the charter vested exclusively in the Trustees, this assembly
could not legislate. Its powers were limited to discussing and suggesting
such measures as its members might deem conducive to the welfare of particular
communities and important for the general good of the province.</p>

<p>The “Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in America”
resolved to surrender their charter and relieve themselves from the further
execution of a trust which had grown quite beyond their management.
For twenty years they had supported its provisions with an earnest solicitude,
a philanthropic zeal, a disinterested purpose, and a loyal devotion
worthy of every commendation. They had seen a feeble plantation upon
Yamacraw Bluff expand year by year, until it now assumed the proportions
of a permanent colony and disclosed the potentialities of a future nation.
The English drum-beat on the banks of the Savannah is answered by the
Highland bagpipe on the Alatamaha, and the protecting guns of Frederica
are supplemented by the sentinel field-pieces at Augusta. At every stage
of progress and in every act, whether trivial or important, these Trustees,
capable and worthy, evinced a clear conception of duty, a patience of
labor, a singleness of purpose, an unselfish dedication of time and energy,
and a rigid adherence to all that was pure, elevated, and humanizing, which
become quite conspicuous when their proceedings are minutely and intelligently
scanned. That they erred in their judgment in regard to the best
method of utilizing many of these marish lands, smitten by sun and
storms and pregnant with fevers and fluxes, may not now be doubted;
that the theory upon which they administered the trust was in some
respects narrow and retarding in its influences, is equally certain; that
they were unfortunate in the selection of some of their agents excites no
surprise,&mdash;but that they were upright, conscientious, observant, and most
anxious to promote the best interests of the colony, as they comprehended
them, will be freely admitted.</p>

<p>The surrender of the charter was formally concluded on the 23d of
June, 1752; and Georgia, no longer the ward of the Trustees, passed into
the hands of the Crown. Until clothed with the attributes of State sovereignty
by the successful issue of the American Revolution, she was recognized as
one of the daughters of England under the special charge of the Lords
Commissioners for Trade and Plantations. By the terms of the surrender,
her integrity as an independent province, separate from South Carolina, was
fully assured, and all grants of land, hitherto made to the inhabitants, were
recognized and respected.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Mr. Parker, Patrick Graham succeeded to the presidency
of Georgia. Until a plan for establishing a civil government could
be perfected, all officers, both civil and military, holding appointments from
the Trustees, were continued in their respective places of trust, with such
emoluments, salaries, and fees as were incident thereto. The population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
of the colony now consisted of two thousand three hundred and eighty-one
whites, and one thousand and sixty-six negro slaves. This estimate
did not include His Majesty’s troops and boatmen, or a congregation of two
hundred and eighty whites, with negro slaves aggregating five hundred and
thirty-six, coming from South Carolina and partially settled in the Midway
District, or Butler’s Colony with sixty slaves.</p>

<p>The plan suggested by the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations
for the establishment of a civil government in Georgia contemplated
the appointment of a governor, by commission under the Great
Seal, with the title of <i>Captain-General and Governor-in-chief of His Majesty’s
Province of Georgia, and Vice-Admiral of the same</i>. He was to be
addressed as <i>Your Excellency</i>, and was, within the colony, to be respected
as the immediate and highest representative of His Majesty. His functions,
as well as those of the two Houses of the Assembly, were well
defined.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>The plan thus submitted for the government of the Province of Georgia
received royal sanction; and His Majesty, upon the nomination of the Lords
Commissioners for Trade and Plantations, was pleased, on the 6th of
August, 1754, to appoint Captain John Reynolds governor of the Province
of Georgia; William Clifton, Esq., attorney-general; James Habersham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Esq., secretary and register; Alexander Kellet, Esq., provost-marshal;
William Russel, Esq., naval officer; Henry Yonge and William De Brahm
joint surveyors; Sir Patrick Houstoun, Bart., register of grants and receiver
of quit rents; and Patrick Graham, Sir Patrick Houstoun, James Habersham,
Alexander Kellet, William Clifton, Noble Jones, Pickering Robinson, Francis
Harris, Jonathan Bryan, William Russell, and Clement Martin members
of Council.</p>

<p>When during the same year (1754) the other English colonies sent
delegates to represent them at the Congress of Albany, in order to draft
a plan of union against the French, Georgia filled so narrow a space in
the regard of the other colonies that her failure to join in the proposed
league was hardly remarked.</p>

<p>Only three Royal Governors did Georgia have. The terms of service of
Captain Reynolds and of Henry Ellis were short. Assuming the reins of
government in 1760, the third and last Royal Governor, Sir James Wright,
encountered the storms of the Revolution, and in a brave adherence to the
cause of his royal master suffered arrest, mortification, and loss. It was his
lot to preside at an epoch full of doubt and trouble. During his administration
the political ties which united Georgia to the mother country were
violently sundered, and a union of American colonies was formed, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
after years developed into the great Republic. The rapid development
of Georgia under the conduct of these royal governors will be admitted
when it is remembered that in 1754 her exports did not amount to £30,000
a year; while, at the opening of the Revolutionary War, they did not fall
short of £200,000 sterling.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">GEORGIA was named in honor of the reigning king of England, George II., who
graciously sanctioned a charter, liberal in its provisions, and who granted to the
Trustees a territory, extensive and valuable, for the plantation.</p>

<p>In a report submitted to Congress by the Hon. Charles Lee, attorney-general of
the United States (Philadelphia, 1796), will be found a valuable collection of charters,
treaties, and documents explanatory of the original cession to the “Trustees for establishing
the Colony of Georgia in America,” and of the modifications and enlargements
to which the same was later subjected. The territory which, in 1733, became the Province
of Georgia at an earlier day formed a part of ancient Florida, which stretched in
the Spanish conception from the Gulf of Mexico to the far north and westward to the
Mississippi and indefinitely beyond.</p>

<p>It has fallen to the lot of another writer in the present work to mention the authorities

ceded to the Georgia Trustees is fully unfolded in his <i>Discourse concerning

<p>That the public might be advised of the benevolent character and scope of the undertaking,
and might be made acquainted with the designs of the Trustees with
regard to the proposed colonization of Georgia, two tracts were published with their
sanction: one of them, prepared by Oglethorpe, entitled <i>A New and Accurate Account

promulgated by the Trustees for the conduct of the plantation and for the observance
of its inhabitants are preserved in <i>An Account shewing the Progress of the Colony of

<p>To the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> and to the <i>London Magazine</i> must recourse be had
for valuable letters and contemporaneous documents descriptive of the colonization of
Georgia and the development of the plantation.</p>

<p>There is in Section xxi. of Chapter iii. of the second volume of <i>Navigantium atque
Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or a Complete Collection of Voyages and Travels</i>, etc., by
John Harris (London, 1748), a “History of the Rise, Progress, and Present State of
the Colony of Georgia.” It is prefaced by an excellent map of the province, and is
fortified by illustrative documents. In its twenty-five quarto pages are embraced all
the noted incidents connected with the early life of the colony and the successful
efforts of General Oglethorpe in defending the southern frontier of Georgia against
the assaults of the Spaniards. The value of this contribution cannot well be overestimated.</p>

<p>Another work of genuine merit, acquainting us specially with the condition of Savannah
and the adjacent region, with the settlement of Frederica, and with those preliminary
negotiations which resulted in a postponement of impending hostilities between
Georgia and Florida, is <i>A Voyage to Georgia begun in the year 1735</i>, etc., by Francis
Moore, London, 1744.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>A most detailed statement of the affairs and events of the province will be found
in the three octavo volumes constituting the diary of Colonel William Stephens, for
some time resident Secretary in Georgia of the Trustees, and, upon the departure of
General Oglethorpe, advanced to the responsible position of President of the colony,&mdash;entitled
<i>A Journal of the Proceedings in Georgia beginning October 20th, 1737</i>, which
was printed in London in 1742.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> Of this work but a limited edition was published
by the Trustees, and a complete copy is very difficult to find. While its pages are
cumbered with many trivial matters, this rare <i>Journal</i> is remarkable for accuracy
of statement and minuteness of details. Its author was at the time far advanced
in years, and his narrative is not infrequently colored by his peculiar religious and
political notions. He was a firm friend of the colony, an honest servant of the Trust,
and in all things most obedient and loyal to his king. Retired upon a pension of
£80, he spent his last years on his plantation, near the mouth of Vernon River, which
he called Bewlie [Beaulieu] because of a fancied resemblance to the manor of the
Duke of Montague in the New Forest. There, about the middle of August, 1753, he
died.</p>

articles given by them in aid of the Trust. This carefully written and unique volume,

Grievous was the disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
at the failure of the expedition; unjust and harsh were the criticisms upon its leader.
“One man there is, my Lords,” said the Duke of Argyle in the British House of
Peers, “whose natural generosity, contempt of danger, and regard for the public
prompted him to obviate the designs of the Spaniards and to attack them in their
own territories: a man whom by long acquaintance I can confidently affirm to have
been equal to his undertaking, and to have learned the art of war by a regular education,
who yet miscarried in the design only for want of supplies necessary to success.”<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

<p>Of his successful repulse of the Spanish attack upon the island of St. Simon, the
most spirited narratives are furnished in General Oglethorpe’s official report of the
30th of July, 1742, printed in the 3d volume of the <i>Collections of the Georgia Historical
Society</i>; in the letter of John Smith (who, on board the war vessel “Success,”
participated in the naval engagement), written from Charlestown, South Carolina, on
the 14th of July, 1742, and printed in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>; and in a communication
on file in the Public Record Office in London among the Shaftesbury Papers.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a></p>

<p>That harmony did not always obtain among the Georgia colonists, and that disagreements
between the governing and the governed were sometimes most pronounced,
must be admitted. While the Trustees endeavored to promote the development of
the plantation and to assure the public of the progress of the province, malcontents
there were, who thwarted their plans, questioned the expediency of their regulations,
and openly declared that their misrule and the partiality of the Trust’s servants were
the prolific causes of disquietude and disaster. That General Oglethorpe may, at
times, have been dictatorial in his administration of affairs is quite probable; and
yet it must be admitted that, amid the dangers which environed and the disturbing
influences which beset the development of the province, an iron will and a strong arm
were indispensable for its guidance and protection.</p>

<p>The publication, in the interest of the Trust, of the two pamphlets to which we have
alluded, one entitled <i>An Impartial Inquiry into the State and Utility of the Province
of Georgia</i>, London, 1741,<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> and the other, <i>A State of the Province of Georgia attested
upon Oath in the Court of Savannah, November 10, 1740</i>, London, 1742,<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>&mdash;both exhibiting
favorable views of the condition of the colony and circulated in furtherance
of the scheme of colonization,&mdash;so irritated these malcontents that they indulged in
several rejoinders, among which will be remembered <i>A Brief Account of the Causes that
have retarded the Progress of the Colony of Georgia in America, attested upon oath:
being a proper Contrast to A State of the Province of Georgia attested upon oath and
some other misrepresentations on the same subject</i>, London, 1743.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> The magistrates,
both at Savannah and Frederica, were therein declared to be oppressors of the inhabitants.
General Oglethorpe was accused of tyranny and partiality. It will be observed
that most of the supporting affidavits were verified outside the limits of Georgia. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
desire to sell forbidden articles, and to ply trades for which special licenses had been
issued to others; opposition to the regulation which prohibited the owners of cattle
and hogs from allowing them to run at large on the common and in the streets of
Frederica; alleged misfeasance in the conduct of bailiffs and magistrates in the discharge
of their duties; the unprofitableness of labor, overbearing acts committed by
those in authority, and similar matters, formed the burthen of these sworn complaints.
While they tended to distract the public mind and to annoy those upon whose shoulders
rested the provincial government, they fortunately failed in producing any serious
impression either within the colony or in the mother country.</p>

<p>Another Jacobinical tract was that prepared and published at the instigation of Dr.
Patrick Tailfer,&mdash;a thorn in the side of General Oglethorpe, to whom, under the
signature of “The Plain Dealer,” he addressed a communication upon colonial affairs
full of complaint, condemnation, and sarcasm. He was the chief of a club of malcontents
in Savannah, whose conduct became so notorious that they were forced, in September,
1740, to quit the province and seek refuge in South Carolina. When thus
beyond the jurisdiction of Georgia, in association with Hugh Anderson, David Douglass,
and others, he caused to be printed a scurrilous tract entitled <i>A True and Historical
Narrative of the Colony of Georgia in America from the first Settlement thereof
until the present period</i>, etc., Charles-Town, South Carolina, 1741.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> The epistle dedicatory
is addressed to General Oglethorpe, and is full of venom. Craving rum, negro
slaves, and fee-simple titles to land, such disaffected colonists hesitated not to malign
the authorities, disquiet the settlers, and belie the true condition of affairs. Georgia
was then in an embarrassed and impoverished situation. Her population was increasing
but slowly. Labor was scarcely remunerative. Onerous were some of the regulations
of the Trustees, and the Spanish war cloud was darkening the southern confines
of the province. The impression, however, which Dr. Tailfer and his associates sought
to convey of the status of the colony was exaggerated, spiteful, and without warrant.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<p>The visit of Tomo-chi-chi and his retinue to England is described in contemporaneous
numbers of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> and of the <i>London Magazine</i>. It was also
commemorated in what is now rarely seen, <i>Georgia a Poem</i>; <i>Tomo-cha-chi, an Ode</i>; <i>A
copy of verses on Mr. Oglethorpe’s second voyage to Georgia</i>, “<i>Facies non omnibus una,
nec diversa tamen</i>,” London, 1736. Twenty-two years afterwards appeared <i>Tombo-chi-qui
or The American Savage, a Dramatic Entertainment in Three Acts</i>, London, 1758.
Although printed anonymously, it is generally attributed to Cleland. The poet Freneau,
at a later date, composed an ode to <i>The Dying Indian Tomo-chequi</i>. In the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, vol. x. p. 129, is an interesting letter describing the last moments
and sepulture of this noted Mico. In his <i>Historical Sketch of Tomo-chi-chi,
Mico of the Yamacraws</i>, Albany, 1868, the author of these notes endeavored to present
all that is known of this distinguished chief, to whose friendship and aid the Colony
of Georgia was indebted in a remarkable degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the custom of the Trustees to assemble annually and listen to a sermon delivered
in commendation of the benevolent scheme in which they were engaged. Some
of these discourses possess historical value, although most of them are simply moral
essays.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>In December, 1837, the General Assembly of Georgia empowered the governor of the
State to select a competent person to procure from the government offices in London
copies of all records and documents respecting the settlement and illustrating the
colonial life of Georgia. The Rev. Charles Wallace Howard was entrusted with the
execution of this mission. He returned with copies of documents filling twenty-two
folio volumes. Fifteen of these were made from the originals on file in the office of
the Board of Trade, six from those in the State Paper Office, and the remaining volume
consisted of copies of important documents included in the king’s library.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> These
MS. volumes are preserved in the state library at Atlanta. While they embrace many
of the communications, regulations, reports, treaties, and documents illustrative of the
colonial life of Georgia, they do not exhaust the treasures of the Public Record Office
and the British Museum.</p>

<p>In private hands in England are several original MS. volumes, connected with the
colonization of Georgia and detailing the acts and resolutions of the Trustees.
Prominent among them are two quarto volumes, closely written in the neat, small,
round hand of John Percival, the first Earl of Egmont and the first president of the
Board of Trustees, containing the original manuscript records of the meetings of the
Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in America from June 14th, 1738, to
the 24th of May, 1744.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> They contain also an index of proceedings, June, 1737, to
June, 1738, together with some memoranda relating to the proceedings of 1745-46. It
is probable that there were antecedent volumes, but they are not now known.</p>

<p>In the Department of State, and in the Executive Department of Georgia, are
some documents of great historical interest connected with the English colonization
of Georgia. The <i>Historical Collections</i> of the Georgia Historical Society,<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> in four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
volumes, contain reprints of many of the early tracts already referred to, and other
papers illustrative of Georgia history.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p>In the library of Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, there is a folio
MS. in excellent preservation, entitled <i>History of the three Provinces, South Carolina,
Georgia, and East Florida</i>, by John Gerard William de Brahm, surveyor-general
of the southern provinces of North America, then under the dominion of Great
Britain, and illustrated by over twenty maps and plans. The portion relating to
Georgia was, in 1849, edited and printed with extreme accuracy and typographical
elegance by Mr. George Wymberley-Jones, of Savannah. The edition was limited to
forty-nine copies. Six of the eight maps appertaining to Georgia were engraved.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
This publication constitutes the second of Mr. Jones’ “Wormsloe quartos,”<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
justly esteemed not only for its typography and rarity, but also for its historical
value. To the engineering skill of Captain de Brahm was Georgia indebted for
many important surveys and military defenses. Through his instrumentality were
large accessions made to the German population between Savannah and New Ebenezer.</p>

<p>Of the legislative acts passed by the general assemblies of Georgia during the continuance
of the royal government, many are retained in the digests of Robert and
George Watkins (Philadelphia, 1800), and of Marbury and Crawford. Aware of the
fact that numerous omissions existed, Mr. George Wymberley-Jones De Renne
caused diligent search to be made in the Public Record Office in London for all acts
originating in Georgia which, having received royal sanction, were there filed. Exact
copies of them were then obtained; but Mr. De Renne’s death occurred before he
had compassed his purpose of printing the transcripts. His widow, Mrs. Mary De
Renne, carried out his design and committed the editing of them to Charles C.
Jones, Jr., LL. D. The result was a superb quarto, entitled <i>Acts passed by the General
Assembly of the Colony of Georgia, 1755 to 1774, now first printed</i>. <i>Wormsloe.</i>
1881. The edition was limited to forty-nine copies. In this volume appears no act
which had hitherto found its way into type. During the period covered by this
legislation, James Johnston was the public printer in Savannah. By him were many
of the acts, passed by the various assemblies, first printed,&mdash;sometimes simply as
broadsides, and again in thin quarto pamphlets. William Ewen, who, at a later
date, was president of the Council of Safety, carefully preserved these printed acts,
and caused them to be bound in a volume which lies before us. The MS. index
is in his handwriting. It is the only complete copy of these colonial laws, printed
contemporaneously with their passage, of which we have any knowledge. James
Johnston was also the editor and printer of the <i>Georgia Gazette</i>, the only newspaper
published in Georgia prior to and during the Revolution. In the office of the Secretary
of State in Atlanta are preserved the engrossed original acts passed by the
colonial General Assemblies of Georgia. The sanction of the home government
was requisite to impart vitality to such acts. As soon, therefore, as they had received
the approval of the Governor in Council, the seal of the colony was attached
to duplicate originals. One was lodged with the proper officer in Savannah, and
the other was forwarded for the consideration of the Lords Commissioners for
Trade and Plantations. When by them approved, this duplicate original, properly
indorsed, was filed in London. Detaching the colonial seal seems to have been the
final attestation of royal sanction. Of the action of the home government the colonial
authorities were notified in due course.</p>

<p class="p2">With regard to the sojourn of Rev. John Wesley in Georgia, of his designs and
anticipations in visiting the colony, and of the disappointments there experienced,
we have perhaps the fullest memoranda in a little undated volume entitled <i>An extract
of the Rev. Mr. John Wesley’s Journal from his embarking for Georgia to his
return to London</i>, Bristol; printed by S. and F. Farley. It gives his own interpretation
of the events, trials, and disappointments which induced him so speedily to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
abandon a field of labor in which he had anticipated much pleasure and success.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> In
a tract published in London in 1741, called <i>An Account of money received and disbursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
for the Orphan House in Georgia</i>, the Rev. George Whitefield submits a full
exhibit of all expenditures made up to that time in the erection and support of that
institution. To it is prefixed a plan of the building.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> His efforts to convert it into a
college are unfolded in <i>A Letter to his Excellency Governor Wright</i>, printed in London,
1768. Appended to this is the correspondence which passed between him and
the Archbishop of Canterbury. This tract is illustrated by plans and elevations of
the present and intended structures, and by a plat of the Orphan House lands.
There are sermons of this eloquent divine in aid of this charity, and journals of
journeys and voyages undertaken while employed in soliciting subscriptions. His
friend and companion, the Hon. James Habersham, has left valuable letters explanatory
of the scope and administration of this eleemosynary project. William Bartram,
who visited Bethesda in 1765, wrote a pleasant description of it.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>Among the histories of Georgia we may mention:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>An Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Colonies of South Carolina
and Georgia</i>, London, 1779,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> in two volumes, octavo. Although published anonymously,
these volumes are known to have been written by the Rev. Alexander Hewitt,<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>
a Presbyterian clergyman and a resident of Charlestown, South Carolina, who returned
to England when he perceived that an open rupture between the Crown and the thirteen
American Colonies was imminent. While in this work the colonial history of
Georgia is given at some length, the attention of the author was mainly occupied
with the establishment and growth of the Province of Carolina. His labors ended
with the dawn of the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>To <i>A View of the Constitution of the British Colonies in North America and the
West Indies at the time the Civil War broke out on the Continent of America</i>, by
Anthony Stokes, his Majesty’s Chief Justice in Georgia, London, 1783, we must
refer for the most intelligent history of the civil and judicial conduct of affairs in
Georgia during the continuance of the royal government.</p>

<p>Soon after the formation of the general government Mr. Edward Langworthy&mdash;at
first a pupil and then a teacher at Whitefield’s Orphan House, afterwards an enthusiastic
“Liberty Boy,” Secretary of the Provincial Congress of Georgia, and one
of the early representatives from that State in the Confederated Congress&mdash;conceived
the design of writing a history of Georgia. Of fair attainments, and personally
acquainted with the leading men and transactions of the period, he was well
qualified for the task, and addressed himself with energy to the collection of materials
requisite for the undertaking. From a published prospectus of the work,
printed in the <i>Georgia Gazette</i>, we are led to believe that this history was actually
written. Suitable encouragement not having been extended, the contemplated publication
was never made. Mr. Langworthy died at Elkton, in Maryland, early in the
present century, and all efforts to recover both his manuscripts and the supporting
documents which he had amassed have thus far failed.</p>

<p>From the press of Seymour and Williams, of Savannah, was issued, in 1811, the
first volume of Major Hugh McCall’s <i>History of Georgia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> and this was followed,
in 1816, by the second volume published by William Thorne Williams. Oppressed
by physical infirmities, and a martyr to the effects of exposures and dangers experienced
while an officer in the army of the Revolution; now confined to his couch,
again a helpless cripple moving only in an easy-chair upon wheels; dependent for a
livelihood upon the slender salary paid to him as city jailer of Savannah; often interrupted
in his labors, and then, during intervals of pain, writing with his portfolio
resting upon his knees; without the preliminary education requisite for the scholarly
accomplishment of such a serious undertaking, and yet fired with patriotic zeal, and
anxious to wrest from impending oblivion the fading traditions of the State he loved
so well, and whose independence he had imperilled everything to secure,&mdash;Major
McCall, in the end, compassed a narrative which is highly prized, and which, in its
recital of events connected with the Revolutionary period and the part borne by
Georgians in that memorable struggle, is invaluable. He borrowed largely from Mr.
Hewitt in depicting the colonial life of Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a></p>

<p>As early as March, 1841, the Georgia Historical Society invited Dr. William Bacon
Stevens to undertake, under its auspices, the preparation of a new and complete <i>History
of Georgia</i>. Liberal aid was extended to him in his labor, and of its two
octavo volumes, one was published in 1847 and the other in 1859.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> This author brings
his history down to the adoption of the constitution of 1798.</p>

<p>In 1849 the Rev. George White published in Savannah his <i>Statistics of the State
of Georgia</i>, and this was followed, six years afterwards, by his more comprehensive
and valuable work entitled the <i>Historical Collections of Georgia</i>, illustrated with
nearly one hundred engravings, and published by Pudney and Russell, of New York.
In this volume a vast mass of statistical, documentary, and traditional information is
presented; and for his industry the author is entitled to much commendation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The History of Georgia</i>, by T. S. Arthur and W. H. Carpenter, published in Philadelphia
in 1854, and constituting one of Lippincott’s cabinet histories, is a meagre
compendium of some of the leading events in the life of the Colony and State, and
does not claim special attention.</p>

<p>In his <i>History of Alabama, and incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi</i> (Charleston,
S. C., 1851) Colonel Albert James Pickett furnishes abundant and interesting material
illustrative of the aboriginal epoch; and, in a manner both intelligent and attractive,
traces the colonization of the territory indicated down to the year 1820.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>The present writer has already printed [1883] the first two volumes of <i>History of
Georgia</i>; and his preface unfolds his purpose to tell the story from the earliest times
down to a period within the memory of the living. The two volumes thus far issued
embrace the aboriginal epoch, a narrative of discovery and early exploration,
schemes of colonization, the settlement under Oglethorpe, and the life of the province
under the guidance of the Trustees, under the control of the President and
Assistants, under the supervision of royal governors, and during the Revolutionary
War. They conclude with the erection of Georgia into an independent State. All
available sources of information have been utilized. The two concluding volumes,
which will deal with Georgia as a Commonwealth, are in course of preparation.</p>

<p>We refrain from an enumeration of gazetteers, historical essays, and publications,
partial in their character, which relate to events subsequent to what may be properly
termed the period of colonization.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE WARS ON THE SEABOARD: THE STRUGGLE IN
ACADIA AND CAPE BRETON.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY CHARLES C. SMITH,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Treasurer of the Massachusetts Historical Society</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">ALL through its early history Acadia, or Nova Scotia, suffered from
the insecurity to life and property which arose from its repeated
changes of masters. Neither France nor England cared much for a region
of so little apparent value; and both alike regarded it merely as debatable
ground, or as a convenient make-weight in adjusting the balance of conquests
and losses elsewhere. Nothing was done to render it a safe or
attractive home for immigrants; and at each outbreak of war in the Old
World its soil became the scene of skirmishes and massacres in which Indian
allies were conspicuous agents. Whatever the turn of victory here,
little regard was paid to it in settling the terms of peace. There was
hardly an attempt at any time to establish a permanent control over the
conquered territory. In spite of the capture of Port Royal by Phips in
1690, and the annexation of Acadia to the government of Massachusetts in
1692, it was only a nominal authority which England had. In 1691, the
French again took formal possession of Port Royal and the neighboring
country. In the next year an ineffectual attempt was made to recover it;
and this was followed by various conflicts, of no historical importance, in different
parts of this much-harassed territory. In August, 1696, the famous
Indian fighter, Captain Benjamin Church, left Boston on his fourth eastern
expedition. After skirting the coast of Maine, where he met with but few
Indians and no enemies, he determined to proceed up the Bay of Fundy.
There he captured and burned Beaubassin, or Chignecto, and then returned
to St. John. Subsequently he was superseded by Colonel John Hathorne,
a member of the Massachusetts council, and an attack was made on the
French fort at Nachouac, or Naxoat, farther up the river; but for some unexplained
reason the attack was not pressed, and the English retreated
shortly after they landed. “No notice,” says Hutchinson in his <i>History of
Massachusetts Bay</i>, “was taken of any loss on either side, except the burning
of a few of the enemy’s houses; nor is any sufficient reason given for
relinquishing the design so suddenly.”<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> By the treaty of Ryswick in the
following year (1697) Acadia was surrendered to France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>The French were not long permitted to enjoy the restored territory. In
May, 1704, Church was again placed in command of an expedition fitted
out at Boston against the French and Indians in the eastern country. He
had been expressly forbidden to attack Port Royal, and after burning the
little town of Mines nothing was accomplished by him. Three years later,
in May, 1707, another expedition, of one thousand men, sailed from Boston
under command of Colonel March. Port Royal was regularly invested,
and an attempt was made to take the place by assault; but through the
inefficiency of the commander it was a total failure. Reëmbarking his
little army, March sailed away to Casco Bay, where he was superseded by
Captain Wainwright, the second in command. The expedition then returned
to Port Royal; but in the mean time the fortifications had been diligently
strengthened, and after a brief view of them Wainwright drew off
his forces. In 1710 a more successful attempt for the expulsion of the
French was made. In July of that year a fleet arrived at Boston from England
to take part in a combined attack on Port Royal. In pursuance of
orders from the home government, four regiments were raised in the New
England colonies, and sailed from Boston on the 18th of September. The
fleet numbered thirty-six vessels, exclusive of hospital and store ships, and
on board were the four New England regiments, respectively commanded
by Sir Charles Hobby, Colonel Tailer, of Massachusetts, Colonel Whiting,
of Connecticut, and Colonel Walton, of New Hampshire, and a detachment
of marines from England. Francis Nicholson, who had been successively
governor of New York, Virginia, and Maryland, had the chief command.
The fleet, with the exception of one vessel which ran ashore and was lost,
arrived off Port Royal on the 24th of September. The garrison was in no
condition to resist an enemy, and the forces were landed without opposition.
On the 1st of October three batteries were opened within one hundred
yards of the fort; and twenty-four hours afterward the French capitulated.
By the terms of the surrender the garrison was to be transported
to France, and the inhabitants living within cannon-shot of Port Royal were
to be protected in person and property for two years, on taking an oath of
allegiance to the queen of England, or were to be allowed to remove to
Canada or Newfoundland.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> The name of Port Royal was changed to Annapolis
Royal in compliment to the queen, and the fort was at once garrisoned
by marines and volunteers under the command of Colonel Samuel
Vetch, who had been selected as governor in case the expedition should
prove successful. Its whole cost to New England was upward of twenty-three
thousand pounds, which sum was afterward repaid by the mother
country. Acadia never again came under French control, and by the
treaty of Utrecht (1713) the province was formally ceded to Great Britain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
“according to its ancient limits.” As a matter of fact, those limits were
never determined; but the question ceased to have any practical importance
after the conquest of Canada by the English, though it was reopened
long afterward in the boundary dispute between Great Britain and the
United States.</p>

<p>By the treaty of Utrecht, France was left in undisputed possession of
Cape Breton; and in order to establish a check on the English in Nova
Scotia, the French immediately began to erect strong fortifications at Louisbourg,
in Cape Breton, and invited to its protection the French inhabitants
of Acadia and of Newfoundland, which latter had also been ceded to
Great Britain. Placentia, the chief settlement in Newfoundland, was accordingly
evacuated, and its inhabitants were transferred to Cape Breton;
but such great obstacles were thrown in the way of a voluntary removal of
the Acadians that very few of them joined their fellow countrymen. They
remained in their old homes, to be only a source of anxiety and danger to
their English masters. At the surrender of Acadia to Great Britain, it was
estimated by Colonel Vetch, in a letter to the Board of Trade, that there
were about twenty-five hundred French inhabitants in the country; and
even at that early date he pointed out that their removal to Cape Breton
would leave the country entirely destitute of inhabitants, and make the
new French settlement a very populous colony, “and of the greatest danger
and damage to all the British colonies, as well as the universal trade of
Great Britain.”<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> Fully persuaded of the correctness of this view, the successive
British governors refused to permit the French to remove to Canada
or Cape Breton, and persistently endeavored to obtain from them a full
recognition of the British sovereignty. In a single instance&mdash;in 1729&mdash;Governor
Phillips secured from the French inhabitants on the Annapolis
River an unconditional submission; but with this exception the French
would never take the oath of allegiance without an express exemption from
all liability to bear arms. It is certain, however, that this concession was
never made by any one in authority; and in the two instances in which it
was apparently granted by subordinate officers, their action was repudiated
by their superiors. The designation “Neutral French,” sometimes given
to the Acadians, has no warrant in the recognized facts of history.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the colony remained almost stationary, and attracted very little
notice from the home government. In August, 1717, General Richard
Phillips was appointed governor, which office he retained until 1749, though
he resided in England during the greater part of the time. During his absence
the small colonial affairs were successively administered by the lieutenant-governor
of Annapolis, John Doucette, who held office from 1717 to
1726,<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> and afterward by the lieutenant-governors of the province, Lawrence
Armstrong (1725-1739) and Paul Mascarene (1740-1749). Phillips was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
succeeded by Edward Cornwallis; but Cornwallis held the office only about
three years, when he resigned, and General Peregrine Thomas Hopson was
appointed his successor. On Hopson’s retirement, within a few months,
the government was administered by one of the members of the council,
Charles Lawrence, who was appointed lieutenant-governor in 1754, and
governor in 1756.</p>

<p>In 1744 war again broke out between England and France, and the
next year it was signalized in America by the capture of Louisbourg. Immediately
on learning that war had been declared, the French commander
despatched a strong force to Canso, which captured the English garrison
at that place and carried them prisoners of war to Louisbourg. A second
expedition was sent to Annapolis for a similar purpose, but through the
prompt action of Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts, it failed of success.
Aroused, no doubt, by these occurrences, Shirley formed the plan of capturing
Louisbourg; and early in January, 1745, he communicated his design
to the General Court of Massachusetts, and about the same time
wrote to Commodore Warren, commanding the British fleet in the West
Indies, for coöperation. His plans were favorably received, not only by
Massachusetts, but also by the other New England colonies. Massachusetts
voted to raise 3,250 men; Connecticut 500; and New Hampshire and
Rhode Island each 300. The chief command was given to Sir William
Pepperrell, a wealthy merchant of Kittery in Maine, of unblemished reputation
and great personal popularity; and the second in command was
Samuel Waldo, a native of Boston, but at that time also a resident of
Maine.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> The chief of artillery was Richard Gridley, a skilful engineer,
who, in June, 1775, marked out the redoubt on Bunker Hill. The undertaking
proved to be so popular that the full complement of men was raised
within two months. The expedition consisted of thirteen armed vessels,
under the command of Captain Edward Tyng, with upward of two hundred
guns, and of about ninety transports. They were directed to proceed to
Canso, where a block house was to be built, the stores landed, and a guard
left to defend them. The Massachusetts troops sailed from Nantasket on
the 24th of March, and reached Canso on the 4th of April. The New
Hampshire forces had arrived four days before; the Connecticut troops
reached the same place on the 25th. Hutchinson adds, with grim humor,
“Rhode Island waited until a better judgment could be made of the event,
their three hundred not arriving until after the place had surrendered.”<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p>The works at Louisbourg had been twenty-five years in construction,
and though still incomplete had cost between five and six millions of dollars.
They were thought to be the most formidable defences in America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
and covered an area two and a half miles in circumference. A space of
about two hundred yards toward the sea was left without a rampart; but
at all other accessible points the walls were from thirty to thirty-six feet
in height, with a ditch eighty feet in width. Scattered along their line
were six bastions and three batteries with embrasures for one hundred and
forty-eight cannon, of which only sixty-five were mounted, and sixteen mortars.
On an island at the entrance of the harbor was a battery mounted
with thirty guns; and directly opposite the entrance of the harbor was the
grand battery, mounting twenty-eight heavy guns and two eighteen-pounders.
The entrance to the town on the land-side was over a draw-bridge
defended by a circular battery mounting sixteen cannon. It was these
strong and well-planned works which a handful of New England farmers
and fishermen undertook to capture with the assistance of a small English
fleet.</p>

<p>Pepperrell was detained by the ice at Canso for nearly three weeks, at
the end of which time he was joined by Commodore Warren with four
ships, carrying one hundred and eighty guns. The combined forces
reached Gabarus Bay, the place selected for a landing, on the morning
of the 30th of April; and it was not until that time that the French had
any knowledge of the impending attack. Two days later the grand battery
fell into Pepperrell’s hands through a fortunate panic which seized
the French. Thus encouraged, the siege was pressed with vigor under very
great difficulties. The first battery was erected immediately on landing,
and opened fire at once; but it required the labor of fourteen nights to
draw all the cannon and other materials across the morass between the
landing-place and Louisbourg, and it was not until the middle of May that
the fourth battery was ready. On the 18th of May, Tyng in the “Massachusetts”
frigate captured a French ship of sixty-four guns and five hundred
men, heavily laden with military stores for Louisbourg. This success
greatly raised the spirits of the besiegers, who, slowly but steadily, pushed
forward to the accomplishment of their object. Warren’s fleet was reinforced
by the arrival of three large ships from England and three from
Newfoundland; the land-gate was demolished; serious breaches were made
in the walls; and by the middle of June it was determined to attempt a
general assault. The French commander, Duchambon, saw that further
resistance would be useless, and on the 16th he capitulated with the honors
of war, and the next day Pepperrell took possession of Louisbourg.</p>

<p>By the capitulation six hundred and fifty veteran troops, more than
thirteen hundred militia, and other persons, to the number in all of upward
of four thousand, agreed not to bear arms against Great Britain during
the war, and were transported to France in fourteen ships. Seventy-six
cannon and mortars fell into the hands of the conquerors, with a great
quantity of military stores and provisions. The number killed on the side
of the French was three hundred, and on the side of the English one hundred
and thirty; but subsequently the latter suffered heavily by disease,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
and at one time so many as fifteen hundred were sick from exposure and
bad weather. Tidings of the victory created great joy in New England,
and the news was received with no small satisfaction in the mother country.
Pepperrell was made a baronet, Warren an admiral, and both Shirley
and Pepperrell were commissioned as colonels.  Subsequently, after a
delay of four years, Great Britain reimbursed the colonies for the expenses
of the expedition to the amount of £200,000.</p>

<p>The capture of Louisbourg was by far the most important event in the
history of Nova Scotia during the war, and the loss of so important a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
was a keen mortification to France. As soon as news of the fall of Louisbourg
reached the French government, steps were taken with a view to
its recapture and to the punishment of the English colonists by destroying
Boston and ravaging the New England coast. In June, 1746, a fleet of
eleven ships of the line, twenty frigates, thirty transports, and two fire-ships
was despatched for this purpose under command of Admiral D’Anville;
but the enterprise ended in a disastrous failure. Contrary winds
prevailed during the voyage, and on nearing the American coast a violent
storm scattered the fleet, driving some of the ships back to France and
others to the West Indies, and wrecking some on Sable Island. On
the 10th of September D’Anville cast anchor with the remaining vessels&mdash;two
ships and a few transports&mdash;in Chebucto; and six days later he
died, of apoplexy, it is said. At a council of war held shortly afterward it
was determined to attack Annapolis, against the judgment of Vice-Admiral
D’Estournelle, who had assumed the command. Exasperated, apparently,
at this decision, he committed suicide in a fit of temporary insanity. This
second misfortune was followed by the breaking out of the small-pox among
the crews; and finally after scuttling some of the vessels the officer next in
command returned to France without striking a single blow. In the spring
of the following year another expedition, of smaller size, was despatched
under command of Admiral De la Jonquiere; but the fleet was intercepted
and dispersed off Cape Finisterre by the English, who captured nine ships
of war and numerous other vessels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, and before the capture of Louisbourg, the French had made
an unsuccessful attempt on Annapolis, from which the besieging force was
withdrawn to aid in the defence of Louisbourg, but they did not arrive
until a month after its surrender. In the following year another army
of Canadians appeared before Annapolis; but the place seemed to be so
strong and well defended that it was not thought prudent to press the
attack. The French accordingly withdrew to Chignecto to await the arrival
of reinforcements expected from France. While stationed there they
learned that a small body of New England troops, under Colonel Noble,
were quartered at Grand Pré, and measures were speedily adopted to cut
them off. The attack was made under cover of a snow-storm at an early
hour on the morning of the 4th of February, 1747. It was a complete
surprise to the English. Noble, who was in bed at the time, was killed
fighting in his shirt. A desperate conflict, however, ensued from house
to house, and at ten o’clock in the forenoon the English capitulated with
the honors of war.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> This terminated active hostilities in Nova Scotia,
from which the French troops shortly afterward withdrew. By the disgraceful
peace of Aix la Chapelle (1748) England surrendered Louisbourg
and Cape Breton to the French, and all the fruits of the war in America
were lost.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of peace it was determined by the home government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
to strengthen their hold on Nova Scotia, so as to render it as far as
possible a bulwark to the other English colonies, instead of a source of
danger to them. With this view an advertisement was inserted in the
<i>London Gazette</i>, in March, 1749, setting forth “that proper encouragement
will be given to such of the officers and private men, lately dismissed his
Majesty’s land and sea service, as are willing to accept of grants of land,
and to settle with or without families in Nova Scotia.” Fifty acres were
to be allotted to every soldier or sailor, free from the payment of rents or
taxes for the term of ten years, after which they were not to be required
to pay more than one shilling per annum for every fifty acres; and an
additional grant of ten acres for each person in a family was promised.
Larger grants, with similar conditions, were to be made to the officers;
and still further to encourage the settlement of the province the same inducements
were offered to “carpenters, shipwrights, smiths, masons, joiners,
brickmakers, brick-layers, and all other artificers necessary in building
or husbandry, not being private soldiers or seamen,” and also to surgeons
on producing certificates that they were properly qualified. These offers
were promptly accepted by a large number of persons, but apparently by
not so many as was anticipated.</p>

<p>In the following May Edward Cornwallis, then a member of Parliament,
and uncle of the first Marquis of Cornwallis, was appointed captain-general
and governor in chief, and at once embarked for Nova Scotia with the
new settlers. On the 21st of June he arrived in Chebucto harbor, which
all the officers agreed was the finest harbor they had ever seen; and early
in July he was joined by the transports, thirteen in number, having on
board upward of twenty-five hundred immigrants. The shores of the harbor
were wooded to the water’s edge, “no clear spot to be seen or heard
of.”<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> But by the 23d of the month more than twelve acres were cleared,
and preparations were made for building. A month later the plan of the
town was fully laid out, and subsequently a line of palisades was erected
around the town, a square fort was built on the hill, and a space thirty
feet wide cleared outside of the defensive line. By the end of October
three hundred houses had been completed, a second fort had been built,
and an order had been sent to Boston for lamps to light the streets in
the winter nights. Halifax, as the new town was called, had already begun
to wear the appearance of a settled community; and in little more than
a year its first church was opened for religious services. From the first,
the growth of Halifax was strong and healthy; and it soon became a place
of considerable importance. So early as 1752 the number of inhabitants
amounted to more than four thousand. Stringent rules were adopted to
insure public order and morality; and very soon the governor and council
proceeded to exercise legislative authority.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> But their right to do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
was expressly denied by the law officers at home.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> Accordingly, in the
early part of 1757 a plan was adopted for dividing the province into electoral
districts, for the choice of a legislative body, and was sent to England
for approval. Some exceptions, however, were taken to the plan; and it
was not until October, 1758, that the first provincial assembly met at Halifax,
nineteen members being present.</p>

<p>In the mean time, in 1755, occurred the most memorable and tragic
event in the whole history of Nova Scotia. Though England and France
were nominally at peace, frequent collisions took place between their adherents
in Nova Scotia and elsewhere in America. Early in 1755 it was
determined to dispossess the French of the posts which they had established
on the Bay of Fundy, and a force of eighteen hundred men was
raised in New England, for that purpose, under Lieutenant-Colonels Scott
and John Winslow. The chief command of the expedition was given to
Colonel Robert Monckton, an officer in the English army. The first and
most honorable fruits of the expedition were the capture of the French forts
at Beauséjour and at Gaspereau, both of which surrendered in June. A
few weeks later Winslow became a chief instrument in the forcible removal
of the French Acadians, which has given his name an unenviable notoriety.
It was a task apparently at which his whole nature relucted; and
over and over again he wrote in his letters at the time that it was the most
disagreeable duty he had had to perform in his whole life. But he did not
hesitate for a moment, and carried out with unfaltering energy the commands
of his superior officers.</p>

<p>For more than a generation the French inhabitants had refused to take
the oath of allegiance to the king of England, except in a qualified form.
Upon their renewed refusal, in July, 1755, it was determined to take
immediate steps for their removal, in accordance with a previous decision,
“to send all the French inhabitants out of the province, if they refused
to take the oath;” and at a meeting of the provincial council of
Nova Scotia, held July 28th, “after mature consideration, it was unanimously
agreed that, to prevent as much as possible their attempting to
return and molest the settlers that may be set down on their lands, it
would be most proper to send them to be distributed amongst the several
colonies on the continent, and that a sufficient number of vessels should
be hired with all possible expedition for that purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> Accordingly
orders were sent to Boston to charter the required number of transports;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
and on the 11th of August Governor Lawrence forwarded detailed instructions
to Lieutenant-Colonel Winslow, commanding at Mines, and to Major
John Handfield, a Nova Scotia officer, commanding at Annapolis, to ship
off the French inhabitants in their respective neighborhoods. As the
crops were not yet harvested, and there was delay in the arrival of the
transports, the orders could not be executed until the autumn. At that
time they were carried out with a sternness and a disregard of the rights
of humanity for which there can be no justification or excuse. On the
same day on which the instructions were issued to Winslow and Handfield,
Governor Lawrence wrote a circular letter to the other English governors
in America, expressing the opinion that there was not the least
reason to doubt of their concurrence, and his hope that they would receive
the inhabitants now sent “and dispose of them in such manner as may
best answer our design in preventing their reunion.” According to the
official instructions five hundred persons were to be transported to North
Carolina, one thousand to Virginia, five hundred to Maryland, three hundred
to Philadelphia, two hundred to New York, three hundred to Connecticut,
and two hundred to Boston.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September Winslow issued a citation to the inhabitants
in his immediate neighborhood to appear and receive a communication
from him. The next day, he recorded in his journal, “at three in the afternoon,
the French inhabitants appeared, agreeably to their citation, at the
church in Grand Pré, amounting to four hundred and eighteen of their best
men; upon which I ordered a table to be set in the centre of the church,
and, having attended with those of my officers who were off guard, delivered
them by interpreters the king’s orders.” After a brief preamble he
proceeded to say, “The part of duty I am now upon is what, though
necessary, is very disagreeable to my natural make and temper, as I know
it must be grievous to you who are of the same species. But it is not my
business to animadvert, but to obey such orders as I receive, and therefore
without hesitation shall deliver you his Majesty’s orders and instructions.”
He then informed them that all their lands, cattle, and other property,
except money and household goods, were forfeited to the Crown, and that
all the French inhabitants were to be removed from the province. They
were, however, to have liberty to carry their money and as many of their
household goods as could be conveniently shipped in the vessels; and he
added, “I shall do everything in my power that all those goods be secured
to you, and that you are not molested in carrying them off, and also
that whole families go in the same vessel, and make this remove, which I
am sensible must give you a great deal of trouble, as easy as his Majesty’s
service will admit, and hope that in whatever part of the world you may
fall you may be faithful subjects, a peaceable and happy people.”<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> Meanwhile
they were to remain under the inspection of the troops. Toward
night these unhappy victims, “not having any provisions with them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
pleading hunger, begged for bread,” which was given them, and orders
were then issued that for the future they must be supplied from their
respective families. “Thus ended the memorable 5th of September,”
Winslow wrote in his journal, “a day of great fatigue and trouble.”<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

<p>Shortly afterward the first prisoners were embarked; but great delay
occurred in shipping them off, mainly on account of the failure of the contractor
to arrive with the provisions at the expected time, and it was not
until November or December that the last were shipped. The whole number
sent away at this time was about four thousand. There was also a great
destruction of property; and in the district under command of Winslow
very nearly seven hundred buildings were burned. The presence of the
French was nowhere welcome in the colonies to which they were sent;
and they doubtless experienced many hardships. The governors of South
Carolina and Georgia gave them permission to return, much to the surprise
and indignation of Governor Lawrence;<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> and seven boats, with ninety
unhappy men who had coasted along shore from one of the Southern
colonies, were stopped in Massachusetts. In the summer of 1762 five
transports with a further shipment of these unfortunate people were sent
to Boston, but the General Court would not permit them to land, and they
were ordered to return to Halifax.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p>The removal of the French Acadians from their homes was one of the
saddest episodes in modern history, and no one now will attempt to justify
it; but it should be added that the genius of our great poet has thrown a
somewhat false and distorted light over the character of the victims. They
were not the peaceful and simple-hearted people they are commonly supposed
to have been; and their houses, as we learn from contemporary evidence,
were by no means the picturesque, vine-clad, and strongly built cottages
described by the poet. The people were notably quarrelsome among
themselves, and to the last degree superstitious. They were wholly under
the influence of priests appointed by the French bishops, and directly responsible
to the representatives of the Roman Catholic Church at Quebec.
Many of these priests were quite as much political agents as religious
teachers, and some of them fell under the censure of their superiors for
going too much outside of their religious functions. Even in periods when
France and England were at peace, the French Acadians were a source of
perpetual danger to the English colonists. Their claim to a qualified allegiance
was one which no nation then or now could sanction. But all this
does not justify their expulsion in the manner in which it was executed,
and it will always remain a foul blot on the history of Nova Scotia. The
knowledge of these facts, however, enables us to understand better the constant
feeling of insecurity under which the English settlers lived, and which
finally resulted in the removal and dispersion of the French under circumstances
of such heartless cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>In May of the following year, war was again declared between France
and England; and two years later Louisbourg again fell into the hands of
the English. In May, 1758, a powerful fleet under command of Admiral
Boscawen arrived at Halifax for the purpose of recapturing a place which
ought never to have been given up. The fleet consisted of twenty-three
ships of the line and eighteen frigates, beside transports, and when it left
Halifax it numbered one hundred and fifty-seven vessels. With it was a
land force, under Jeffery Amherst, of upward of twelve thousand men.
The French forces at Louisbourg were much inferior, and consisted of only
eight ships of the line and three frigates, and of about four thousand soldiers.
The English fleet set sail from Halifax on the 28th of May, and on
the 8th of June a landing was effected in Gabarus Bay. The next day the
attack began, and after a sharp conflict the French abandoned and destroyed
two important batteries. The siege was then pushed by regular
approaches; but it was not until the 26th of July that the garrison capitulated.
By the terms of surrender the whole garrison were to become prisoners
of war and to be sent to England, and the English acquired two hundred
and eighteen cannon and eighteen mortars, beside great quantities of
ammunition and military stores. All the vessels of war had been captured
or destroyed; but their crews, to the number of upward of twenty-six hundred
men, were included in the capitulation. Two years later, at the beginning
of 1760, orders were sent from England to demolish the fortress,
render the harbor impracticable, and transport the garrison and stores to
Halifax. These orders were carried out so effectually that few traces of
its fortifications remain, and the place is inhabited only by fishermen.</p>

<p>A year after the surrender of Louisbourg a fatal blow was struck at the
French power in America by the capture of Quebec; and by the peace of
Paris, in February, 1763, the whole of Canada was ceded to Great Britain.
The effects of this cession, in preparing the way for the independence of
the principal English colonies, cannot easily be overestimated; but to Nova
Scotia it only gave immunity from the fear of French incursions, without in
the slightest degree weakening the attachment of the inhabitants to England.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN recent years much attention has been given to the study of Acadian history by local
investigators, and important documents for its elucidation have been obtained from
England and France, and the provincial archives have been put in excellent order by the
commissioner of public records. To his intelligent interest in the subject we are indebted
for one of the most important contributions to our knowledge of it, his <i>Selections from
the Public Documents of the Province of Nova Scotia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> This volume comprises a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
mass of valuable papers illustrative of the history of Nova Scotia in the eighteenth century,
systematically arranged. The first part consists of papers relating to the French
Acadians, 1714-1755; the second part, of papers relating to their forcible removal from
the province, 1755-1768; the third, of papers relating to the French encroachments, 1749-1754,
and the war in North America, 1754-1761; the fourth, of papers relating to the first
settlement of Halifax, 1749-1756; and the last part, of papers relating to the first establishment
of a representative assembly in Nova Scotia. Mr. Akins has added a sufficient
number of biographical and other notes, and has inserted a conveniently arranged Index.</p>

<p>Next in importance to this volume are the publications of the Nova Scotia Historical
Society, which was formed in 1878, and incorporated in 1879. Since that time it has
printed four small volumes of <i>Collections</i>, comprising many valuable papers. Of these
the most important is the journal of Colonel Winslow at the time of the expulsion of the
Acadians, printed (vol. iii. p. 114) from the original manuscript in the possession of the
Massachusetts Historical Society. There are also (vol. i. p. 119) the diary of the surgeon,
John Thomas, at the same time,<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> beside a journal of the capture of Annapolis in 1710, a
history of St. Paul’s Church, Halifax, and other papers of historical interest and value.
The fourth volume contains a Memoir of Samuel Vetch, the first English governor of
Nova Scotia, with illustrative documents, and the journal of Colonel John Winslow, during
the Siege of Beauséjour, in 1755.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>Another work of great authority, as well for the later as for the early history of Nova
Scotia, is Murdoch’s <i>History of Nova Scotia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> Written in the form of annals, it is somewhat
confused in arrangement, and a reader or student is under the necessity of picking
out important facts from a great mass of chaff; but it is a work of wide and thorough research,
and should be carefully studied by every one who wishes to learn the minute facts
of Nova Scotia history.</p>

<p>The early history of Nova Scotia, from its first settlement down to the peace of Paris
in 1763, is treated with much fulness by James Hannay in a well-written narrative, which
is not, however, entirely free from prejudice, especially against the New England colonies.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>
But, for thoroughness of investigation and general accuracy of statement, Mr.
Hannay must hold a high place among local historians. Fortunately his labors are well
supplemented by Duncan Campbell’s <i>History of Nova Scotia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> which was, indeed, published
at an earlier date, but which is, however, very meagre for the period when Acadia
was a French colony.</p>

<p>Beside these, there are several county and town histories, of which the best is Dr. Patterson’s
<i>History of Pictou</i>.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> It is a work of diligent and faithful research, gathering up
much traditional knowledge, and especially full in details respecting the origin and later
fortunes of Pictou Academy. There are also a considerable number of local histories in
manuscript in the archives of the Nova Scotia Historical Society.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Queen Anne’s or Governor Dudley’s
War.</span>&mdash;One of the first acts of the ministry
of Queen Anne was to issue a declaration
of war against France, May 15, 1702, opening
what is known in Europe as the “War of the
Spanish Succession.” Governor Dudley in June,
1703, went to Casco, to avert by a conference
the Indian participancy in the war, if possible.
Campbell, the Boston postmaster, in one of his
<i>Public Occurrences</i> says that Dudley found the
Indians at the eastward “two thirds for peace,
and one third for war.” (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
ix. 495.) These latter were the more easterly
tribes, who came under French influence, and
in Aug., 1703, Dudley issued at Boston a broadside
declaration against the Penicooke and eastern
Indians. (Haven’s list, p. 351.) Plunder
and massacre along the frontier settlements at
the eastward soon convinced the people of New
England that they must prepare for another
murderous war. (Cf. “Indian Troubles on the
Coast of Maine,” documents in <i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i>,
iii. 341.)</p>

<p>The first organized retaliatory assault was the
maritime expedition to the Bay of Fundy, led in
1704 by Col. Benjamin Church.</p>

<p>Church’s own part in this expedition is set
forth in the <i>Entertaining Passages</i>,<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> where will
be found Governor Dudley’s instructions to
Church (p. 104). John Gyles, who in his youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
had been a captive among the French and Indians,
when
he learned
to speak
French,
served as interpreter
and lieutenant.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> Church’s conduct of the expedition,
which had promised much and had
been of heavy cost to the province, had not answered
public expectation, and crossed the judgment
of such as disapproved the making of retaliatory
cruelties the object of war. This view
qualifies the opinions which have been expressed
upon Church’s exploits by Hutchinson (<i>Hist.
Mass.</i>, ii. 132); Williamson (<i>Hist. Maine</i>, ii. 47);
and Palfrey (<i>Hist. N. Eng.</i>, iv. 259). Hannay
(<i>Acadia</i>, 264) calls Church “barbarous.” It is
his own story and that of Penhallow which have
given rise to these opinions.</p>

<p>Church’s instructions had not contemplated
the risks of an attack on Port Royal, and in ignorance
of this Charlevoix accuses the assailants
of want of courage, and Dr. Shea, in editing
that writer,<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> stigmatizes the devastations as
“inhuman and savage,” and refers to a French
account in <i>Canada Documents</i><a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> (III. ii. pp. 648-652)
called “Expeditions faites par les Anglois
de la Nouvelle Angleterre au Port Royal, aux
Mines et à Beaubassin de l’Acadie.”</p>

<p>The French early the next year, under Subercase,
inflicted similar devastation upon the Newfoundland
coast, though the forts at St. John
resisted an attack. There is an original account
by Pastour de Costebelle, dated at Plaisance,
Oct. 22, 1705, in the possession of Dr. Geo.
H. Moore, which has been printed in the <i>Mag.
of Amer. Hist.</i>, Feb., 1877. Charlevoix (Shea’s
translation, iv. 172) naturally relishes the misery
of these savages better than he does the equally
brutal business of Church.</p>

<p>Palfrey (iv. 269) found in the British Colonial
Office a paper dated Quebec, Oct. 20, 1705, containing
proposals for a peace between New England
and Canada, in which Vaudreuil<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> suggested
that both sides should “hinder all acts of hostility”
on the part of the Indians.</p>

<p>Cf. for this attempted truce and for correspondence
at this time between Dudley and Vaudreuil,
<i>Collection de manuscrits relatifs à l’histoire de la
Nouvelle France</i> (Quebec, 1884), vol. ii. pp. 425-28,
435-40, 452.</p>

<p>The Abenakis continuing to disturb the borders,<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>
Dudley planned an attack on Port Royal,
which should be carried out, and be no longer
a threat;<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> and Subercase, then in command
there, was in effect surprised in June, 1707, at
the formidable fleet which entered the basin.
Inefficiency in the English commander, Colonel
March, and little self-confidence and want of discipline
in his force, led to the abandonment of
the attack and the retirement of the force to
Casco Bay, where, reinforced and reinspirited
by a commission of three persons<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> sent from
angry Boston, it returned to the basin, but accomplished
no more than before.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

<p>These successive disappointments fell at a time
when the two Mathers were defeated (through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Dudley’s contrivances, as was alleged) in the
contest for the presidency of Harvard College.
This outcome made for Dudley two bitter and
unscrupulous enemies, and any abuse they might
shower upon him gained a ready hearing in a
belief, prevalent even with fair people, that Dudley
was using his own position for personal
gain in illicit trade with Acadia. There have
been reprinted in the second volume of the <i>Sewall
Papers</i> three testy tracts which grew out of this
conjunction of affairs. In
them Dudley is charged
with the responsibility of
these military miscarriages,
and events are given a turn
which the careful historian
finds it necessary to scrutinize closely.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>Palfrey (iv. 273) pictures the universal
chagrin and details the efforts to shift the
blame for the failure of this expedition.
Charlevoix gives a pretty full account, but
his editor claims that the English chroniclers
resort to vagueness in their stories. In some
copies of Diéreville’s <i>Relation du voyage du Port
Royal de l’Acadie</i> (Amsterdam, 1710) there is an
appendix on the 1707 expedition, taken from
the <i>Gazette</i> of Feb. 25, 1708.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p>Events were tending towards a more strenuous
effort at the reduction of Acadia. Jeremiah
Dummer, in London, had in 1709 presented a
memorial to the ministry arguing that the banks
of the St. Lawrence belonged of right to New
England.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> It is printed in <i>The Importance and
Advantage of Cape Breton</i>, London, 1746.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> In
April, 1709, the home government despatched
orders to the colonies<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> for an extended movement
on Montreal by way of Lake Champlain,
and another on Quebec by water,&mdash;the latter
part of the plan falling to the lot of Massachusetts
and Rhode Island, who were promised the
coöperation of a royal fleet and a force of veterans.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>
Colonel Vetch, who was a prime mover
in the proceeding, brought the messages of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
royal pleasure, and was made the adjutant-general
of the commander, Francis Nicholson; but
the promised fleet did not come, and the few
king’s ships which were in Boston were held
aloof by their commanders, and a project to turn
the troops, already massed in Boston, against
Port Royal, since there was no chance of success
against Quebec unaided, was abandoned for
want of the convoy these royal ships might have
afforded.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> Nicholson, the companion of Vetch,
returned to England,<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> and the next year (1710)
came back with a small fleet, which, with an expeditionary
force of New Englanders, captured
Port Royal,<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> and Vetch was left governor of the
country.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p>Col. William Dudley under date of Nov. 15,
1710, sent to the Board of Trade a communication
covering the journal of Col. Nicholson during
the siege, with correspondence appertaining,
and these papers from the Record Office, London,
are printed in the <i>Nova Scotia Hist. Soc.
Collections</i>, i. p. 59, as (p. 64) is also a journal
from the <i>Boston News-Letter</i> of Nov. 6, 1710. Sabin
(ix. no. 36,703) notes a very rare tract: <i>Journal
of an Expedition performed by the forces of
our Soveraign Lady Anne, Queen, etc., under the
command of the Honourable Francis Nicholson in
the year 1710, for the reduction of Port Royal in

the Rev. Mr. Buckingham is printed from the
original MS., edited by Theodore Dwight, in the

(New York, 1825).<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></p>

<p>The war was ended by a treaty at Portsmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
July 11, 1713. (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxix. p. 1; <i>N.
H. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i. p. 83; <i>N. H. Prov. Papers</i>,
iii. 543; <i>Maine Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vi. 250; Penhallow,
78; Williamson’s <i>Maine</i>, ii. 67.)</p>

<p>There was a conference with five of the leading
eastern Indians at Boston, Jan. 16, 1713-14,
and this treaty is in the <i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxix. 22.
A fac-simile of its English signatures is annexed.
Another conference was held at Portsmouth,
July 23-28, 1714; and this document is also preserved.
(<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxix. 36; <i>Maine Hist.
Soc. Coll.</i>, vi. 257.)</p>

<p>Dr. Shea (<i>Charlevoix</i>, v. 267) says that no intelligent
man will believe that the Indians understood
the law-terms of these treaties, adding
that Hutchinson (ii. 246) admits as much.</p>

<p>The papers by Frederick Kidder in the <i>Maine
Hist. Soc. Collections</i> (vols. iii. and vi.) were republished
as <i>Abnaki Indians, their treaties of
1713 and 1717, and a vocabulary with an historical

fac-similes of the autographs of the English signers
and witnesses; and of the marks or signs
of the Indians.</p>

<p>A later conference to ratify the treaty of 1713
was published under the title of <i>Georgetown on
Arrowsick island, Aug. 9, 1717.... A conference
of Gov. Shute with the sachems and chief men of
the eastern Indians</i>, Boston, 1717. (Harvard
Col. library, no. 5325.24; Brinley, i. no. 431.)
This tract is reprinted in the <i>Maine Hist. Soc.

among the more central settlements between
1639 and 1775.</p>

of New England with the eastern Indians, or a
narrative of their continued perfidy from the 10th
of August, 1703, to the peace renewed 13th of July,
1713; and from the 25th of July, 1722, to their submission,
15th December, 1725, which was ratified
August 5th, 1726</i>. <i>By Samuel Penhallow.</i> Boston,
1726. The author was an Englishman, who
in 1686, at twenty-one, had come to America to
perfect his learning in the college at Cambridge,
designing to acquire the Indian tongue, and to
serve the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
among the Indians. Trade and public office,
however, diverted his attention, and he became
a rich tradesman at Portsmouth and a man of
consideration in the public affairs of New Hampshire.
His book is of the first value to the historian
and the object of much quest to the collector,
for it has become very rare. Penhallow
died Dec., 1726, shortly after its publication. It
has been reprinted in the first volume of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
<i>N. H. Hist. Society’s Collections</i>, and again in 1859
at Cincinnati, with a memoir and notes by W.
Dodge.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

<p>A more comprehensive writer is Samuel
Niles, in his <i>French and Indian Wars</i>, 1634-1760.
Niles was a Rhode Islander, who came
to Harvard College the first from that colony
to seek a liberal education, and, having graduated
in 1699, he settled in Braintree, Mass., in
1711, where he continued till his death in 1762.
Palfrey (vol. iv. 256) has pointed out that Niles
did little more than add a sentence, embody a
reflection, and condense or omit in the use which
he made of the <i>Memorial</i> of Nathaniel Morton,
the <i>Entertaining Passages</i> of Church, the <i>Indian
Wars</i> of Hubbard, the <i>Magnalia</i> of Mather, and
the <i>History</i> of Penhallow; so that for a period
down to about 1745, Niles is of scarcely any
original value.</p>

<p>John Adams (<i>Works</i>, x. 361),

<p>There are two other important contemporary
printed accounts of this war.</p>

<p>Col. Benjamin Church furnished the memoranda
from which his son Thomas constructed
a book, very popular in its day, and which was
published in Boston in 1716, as <i>Entertaining
Passages</i>,<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> etc.</p>

<p>Cotton Mather, on the restoration of peace,
reviewed the ten years’ sorrows of the war in
a sermon before the governor and legislature,
which was published as <i>Duodecennium Luctuosum&mdash;the
History of a long war with Indian
savages and their directors and abettors</i>, 1702-1714.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">GUT OF ANNAPOLIS.</p>
       <p class="pf400"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The above cut represents the entrance to the Annapolis basin, as it would appear to a spectator at the position corresponding to the letter B in the words
“Baye Françoise” in the northwest corner of the map on the opposite page. It follows on a reduced scale one of the coast scenes made by the British engineers to
accompany the hydrographic surveys, published by Des Barres, just before the American Revolutionary War, and which frequently make part of the <i>Atlantic Neptune</i>. A
modern drawing of the view looking outward through the gut is given in E. B. Chase’s <i>Over the Border</i> (Boston, 1884), where will be found a view of the old block house
in Annapolis (p. 64), which stood till 1882.</p>

<p class="pf400">The map (on the opposite page) is by the royal (French) engineer Nicolas Bellin, and was published by Charlevoix in his <i>Histoire de la Nouvelle France</i>, and is reproduced
in Dr. Shea’s translation of Charlevoix, v. p. 170; and on a reduced scale in Gay, <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. p. 125. A MS. plan (1725) is noted in the <i>Catalogue of
the King’s Maps in the British Museum</i>, i. p. 38; as also are other plans of 1751, 1752, 1755. One of date 1729 by Nathaniel Blackmore is plate no. 27 in Moll’s <i>New
Survey of the Globe</i>. One of 1733 is in the North collection of maps in Harvard College library, vol. ii. pl. 11. One of 1779, after a manuscript in the Dépôt des Cartes
in Paris, is no. 11 in the <i>Neptune Americo-Septentrional</i>. This Bellin map may be compared with the draughts of the basin made in the early part of the preceding century
by Lescarbot, published in his <i>Histoire de la Nouvelle France</i> (1609), and by Champlain as given in his <i>Voyages du Sieur de Champlain Xaintongeois</i> (1613),&mdash;both
of which maps are produced in the present <i>History</i>, Vol. IV. pp. 140, 141.</p>

<p class="pf400">There is on a previous page a view of the town and fort of Annapolis at the upper end of the basin. Various papers respecting Annapolis Royal, as it was called after
coming into English possession, can be found in the <i>Belknap Papers</i> (MSS.) in the library of the Massachusetts Historical Society, including letters from Governor Richard
Phillips, Lieutenant-Governor John Doucett, and Paul Mascarene. The history of Nova Scotia so much centres in Annapolis, previous to the founding of Halifax,
that all the histories of Acadia and Nova Scotia tell the story of the picturesque and interesting region in which the town is situated. (Cf. Vol. IV. p. 156.)</p>

<p class="pf400">Jacques Nicolas Bellin, the maker of the opposite map, as he was of all the maps given by Charlevoix, was born in Paris in 1703, and died in 1772. He was one of
the principal hydrographers of his time in France, and was the earliest to hold a governmental position in the engineer department of the Marine. He has left a large
mass of cartographical work, chiefly given on a large scale in his <i>Neptune Français</i> (1753 in folio) and his <i>Hydrographie Française</i> (1756 in folio). The same, with
other maps reproduced on a smaller scale, constitute his <i>Petit Atlas Maritime</i> (1764, five volumes in quarto). All of these publications contain maps of American interest,
and in 1755 he printed a special contribution to the study of American cartography, <i>Mémoires sur les cartes des côtes de l’Amérique septentrionale</i>.</p>

<p>The uneasy disposition of the times upon the
conclusion of the peace may be followed in
Gov. Shute’s letter to the Jesuit Father Rasle,
Feb. 21, 1718 (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, v. 112); in the
conference with the Penobscots<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> and Norridgewocks,
at Georgetown, Oct. 12, 1720 (<i>Mass. Archives</i>,
xxix. 68); and in the letter of the eastern
Indians (in French) to the governor, July 27,
1721 (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, xviii. 259).</p>

<p class="p1"><b>C.</b> <span class="smcap">Lovewell’s or Gov. Dummer’s War.</span>&mdash;There
are documents from the Penhallow
Papers relative to the Indian depredations at
the eastward in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Gen. Register</i>,
1878, p. 21. Some of them antedate the
outbreak of the war. Charlevoix (Shea’s ed.,
vol. v. 268) tells the story of the counter-missions
of the French and English; and the Indians,
incited by the French, made demands on
the English, who held some of their chiefs as
hostages in Boston. (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, 2d ser.,
viii. 259; <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 903; Kip, <i>Jesuit
Missions</i>, 13.) The seeming truce with the Abenakis
was further jeopardized by the act of seizing
(Dec., 1721) the younger Baron de St. Castin,
when he was taken to Boston for examination.
After a detention of five months he was set at
liberty.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> A more serious source of complaints
with the Indians before the war was the attempt
to seize Father Rasle in Jan., 1722, by an expedition
sent to Norridgewock under Col. Westbrook,
but in the immediate charge of Capt. Harmon.
(<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, ix. 910; Rasle in Kip,
15.) Rasle was warned and escaped, but the
party found letters from Vaudreuil in his cabin,
implicating the Quebec governor as having incited
the increasing depredations of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a></p>

<p>The war began in the summer of 1722. Gov.
Shute made his declaration, July 25, 1722 (<i>Mass.
Archives</i>, xxxi. 106), and the Rev. Benjamin
Wadsworth, at the Thursday lecture, Aug. 16,
made it the subject of his discourse. (Brinley,
i. no. 429.)</p>

<p>In March, 1723, Col. Thos. Westbrook made
a raid along the Penobscot. (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>,
xxii. 264; <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, ix. 933.)</p>

<p>Capt. Jeremiah Moulton, under orders of Col.
Westbrook, made a scouting expedition in the
early summer of 1723, and dated at York, July,
4, his report to Lieut.-Gov. William Dummer,
which is printed in the <i>Maine Hist. and Genealog.
Recorder</i>, i. p. 204. (Cf. Penhallow, 96; Niles
in <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, xxxv. 345; Williamson, ii.
120.) In 1723 there was an Indian raid on Rutland,
in which the Rev. Joseph Willard and
two children were killed, and two others were
carried off. (Cf. Israel Loring’s <i>Two Sermons</i>,
Boston, 1724, cited in Brinley, i. no. 1,928.)</p>

<p>A conference was held at Boston, August 22,
1723, of which there is a printed account among
the <i>Belknap Papers</i> (MSS.), in the Mass. Hist.
Soc. library.</p>

<p>On the 21st July, 1724, there was another conference
with the Indians held at St. Georges
fort. (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxix. 154.)</p>

<p>In Aug., 1724, Moulton and Harmon were sent
to make an end of Rasle’s influence. They surprised
the Norridgewock settlement, and Rasle
was killed in the general slaughter. The opposing
chroniclers do not agree as to the manner
of his death. Charlevoix (Shea’s ed., v. 279)
says he was shot and mutilated at the foot of
the village cross. The English say they had
intended to spare him, but he refused quarter,
and had even killed a captive English boy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
the confusion. His scalp and those of other
slain were taken to Boston.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p>In Nov., 1724, Capt. John Lovewell and two
others had petitioned to be equipped to scour
the woods to the eastward after Indians, and,
the legislature acceding (Nov. 17) to their request,
Lovewell enrolled his men and made
three campaigns in quick succession. The journal
of his second expedition (Jan.-Feb., 1724-5)
is in the <i>Mass. Archives</i>, vol. lxxxvi., and is
printed by Kidder in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i>, Jan., 1853, and in his <i>Expeditions of Capt.
John Lovewell</i>. It was on the third of these
expeditions, May 9, 1725, that Lovewell encountered
the Indians near a pond in Fryeburg,
Maine, now known as Lovewell’s pond, upon
whose wood-girt surface the summer tourist to-day
looks down from the summit of the Jockey-Cap.
Their leader was killed early in the action,
which lasted all day, and only nine of the
English who remained alive were unwounded
when the savages drew off.</p>

<p>The news reached Boston on the 13th of May.
Kidder gives the despatches received by the
governor, with the action of the council upon
them. On the 17th an account was printed in
the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, which is also in Kidder.
The day before (May 16) the Rev. Thomas
Symmes, of Bradford, who had gathered his information
from some of those who had escaped,
delivered a sermon in that town, which, when
printed with an “historical preface or memoirs
of the battle at Piggwacket,” became popular,
and two editions were printed at Boston during
the same year. Both editions are of the greatest
rarity. The first is called: <i>Lovewell lamented,
or a Sermon occasion’d by the fall of the
brave Capt. John Lovewell and several of his valiant
company in the late heroic action at Piggwacket</i>.
Boston, 1725.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> The other edition was
entitled: <i>Historical memoirs of the late fight at
Piggwacket; with a sermon occasion’d by the
fall of the brave Capt. John Lovewell and several
of his valiant company.... The second edition,
corrected</i>. Boston, 1725.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> A third edition was
printed at Fryeburg, with some additions, in
1799. The narrative, but not the sermon, was
later printed in Farmer and Moore’s <i>Historical
Collections</i>, i. 25. At Concord (N. H.), in 1861,
it was again issued by Nathaniel Bouton, as
<i>The original account of Capt. John Lovewell’s
Great Fight with the Indians at Pequawket, May
8, 1725</i>.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> Mr. Frederic Kidder, in <i>N. E. Hist.
and Geneal. Reg.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> Jan., 1853 (p. 61), printed
an account of Lovewell’s various expeditions,
with sundry documents from the <i>Massachusetts
Archives</i>, which, together with the second edition
of Symmes, were later, in 1865, embodied
in his <i>Expeditions of Capt. John Lovewell and
his encounters with the Indians, including a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
account of the Pequauket battle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> This is
a faithful reprint of the Symmes tract, while
those of Farmer and Moore, and of Bouton, introduce
matters from other sources. The bibliography
of Symmes’s sermon is traced in Dr. S.
A. Green’s <i>Groton during the Indian Wars</i>, p. 134.</p>

<p>The relations of the French to the Abenaki
war during 1724-25 are shown in various documents
printed in the <i>N. Y. Coll. Docs.</i>, vol. ix.,
as when the French ministry prompts the governor
of Canada to sustain the savages in their
struggle with the English (p. 935); a memoir
is registered upon their condition (p. 939); Intendant
Begon reports on the war (p. 941);
other letters are written (p. 945); and the ministry
again counsel the governor to instigate
further hostilities (p. 956).</p>

<p>A journal of a scout by Westbrook, beginning
June 23, 1725, is among the <i>Belknap Papers</i>
(MSS.).</p>

<p>Four eastern sagamores came to Boston, Nov.
10, 1725 (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxix. 191; Murdoch’s
<i>Nova Scotia</i>, i. 429), and a treaty with them was
signed Dec. 15, 1725, known as “Dummer’s
treaty” (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxxiv.), which was ratified
at Falmouth, Aug. 6, 1726. (<i>Mass. Archives</i>,
xxix. 230; xxxiv. See also Penhallow,
117; <i>N. H. Hist. Coll.</i>, i. 123; <i>N. H. Prov.
Papers</i>, iv. 188; Niles in <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>,
xxxv. 360; Williamson, ii. 145, 147; Palfrey, iv.
443.)</p>

<p>This treaty was separately printed under the
title of <i>Conference with the Indians at the ratification
of peace held at Falmouth, Casco Bay, by
Governour Dummer, in July and August, 1726</i>.
Boston, 1726, pp. 24. It was reprinted in 1754.
(Cf. Brinley, i. 432, 434; Harvard College library,
5325.32.)</p>

<p>There was another Indian treaty at Casco
Bay, July 25, 1727. (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxix. 256.)
In Akins’s <i>Pub. Doc. of Nova Scotia</i> is a fac-simile
of a copy of this treaty, attested by Dummer,
evidently made to be used by Cornwallis in
1749, in negotiating another treaty. (Cf. <i>N. H.
Hist. Coll.</i>, ii. 260, where the treaty is printed;
and the explanation of the Indians in <i>N. Y.
Col. Docs.</i>, ix. 966.)</p>

<p>This treaty of 1727 was separately printed as
<i>Conference with the Eastern Indians at the further
ratification of the peace, held at Falmouth, in
Casco Bay, in July, 1727</i>. Boston, 1727, pp. 31.
It was reprinted in 1754. (Cf. Brinley, i. 433,
434.)</p>

<p>Cf. also <i>Conferences of Lieut.-Gov. Dummer
with the Eastern Indians in 1726 and 1727</i>. Boston,

<i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i>, iii. 377, 407; <i>N. H. Prov.
Papers</i>, iv. 255-258; Palfrey, iv. 444.</p>

<p>There is in the <i>Mass. Archives</i> (xxix. 283) the
document which resulted from a conference with
the Eastern Indians in the council chamber in
Boston, Dec. 9-Jan. 15, 1727-28.</p>

<p>Dr. Colman’s memoir of the troubles at the
eastward in 1726-27 is in the <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>,
vi. 108. (Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, x. 324.)</p>

<p>The French were disconcerted by the treaty
of 1727, as sundry papers in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>,
vol. ix., show. They reiterate their complaints
of the English encroachments on the Indians’
lands (p. 981); observe great changes in the
Abenakis since they made peace with the English
(p. 990); and the king of France tells the
Canadians he does not see how the Indians
could avoid making the treaty with the English
(p. 995).<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<p>The letters of caution, which Belcher was
constantly writing (1731-1740) to Capt. Larrabee,
in command at Fort George, Brunswick,
indicate how unstable the peace was. (<i>N. E.
Hist. &amp; Gen. Reg.</i>, Apr., 1865, p. 129.) The
continued danger from French intrigue is also
shown in Colman’s memoir, etc., in <i>Mass. Hist.
Coll.</i>, vi. 109, and in the repeated conferences
of the next few years: <i>Conference of his Excellency
Governor Belcher with the chiefs of the Penobscot,
Norridgewock, and Ameriscoggin tribes
at Falmouth, July, 1732</i>. Boston, reprinted at
London. (Haven in Thomas, ii. p. 428; Carter-Brown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>

<p><i>A Conference held at Deerfield, the 27th of August</i>
[to Sept. 1], 1735, <i>by his Excellency, Jonathan
Belcher, and Ountaussoogoe and others</i>, etc.

<p>Conference with the Penobscots at the council
chamber in Boston, June, 1736. (<i>Mass. Archives</i>,
xxix. 317.)</p>

<p>The nine Penobscot chiefs who held this conference
were lodged with one John Sale in Boston,
who renders an account of his charges for
twenty-four days’ entertainment of them, which
is suggestive. He charges for three half-pints
of wine, per day, each; for twelve pence worth
of rum per day, each; for 120 gallons of cider;
for damage done in breaking of sash doors,
frames of glass, China bowl, double decanter,
and sundry glasses and mugs; for two gross of
pipes and tobacco; for candles all night; for
showing them the rope-dancers; for washing
49 of their “greasy shirts;” and “for cleaning
and whitewashing two rooms after them.” The
following “memorandum” is attached: “They
eat for the most part between 50 and 60 pounds
of meat per day, beside milk, cheese, etc. The
cider which they drank I sold for twelve shillings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
per quart. Besides, they had beer when
they pleased. And as for meat, they had the
best, as I was ordered.”</p>

<p class="p1"><b>D.</b> <span class="smcap">King George’s, Shirley’s, or Five

England, Mar. 15, 1744 (<i>Coll. de Manuscrits</i>,
Quebec, iii. p. 196), and the capitulation of
Canso had taken place, May 24. (<i>Ibid.</i>, iii.
p. 201.) In July, 1744, Pepperrell and others,
including some chiefs of the Five Nations,
met the Penobscots at St. Georges and
agreed to join in a treaty against the Cape Sable
Indians. The Penobscots did not keep the appointment.
War was declared against the Cape
Sable and St. John’s Indians, Oct. 19, 1744.
The General Court of Massachusetts offered
a reward for scalps; and a proclamation was
made for the enlistment of volunteers, Nov. 2,
1744. (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxxi. 506, 514; printed
in W. W. Wheildon’s <i>Curiosities of History</i>, Boston,
1880, pp. 107, 109.)</p>

<p>The most brilliant event of the war was impending.</p>

<p>The French had begun the construction of
elaborate defences at Louisbourg in 1720. A
medal struck in commemoration of this beginning
is described in the <i>Transactions</i> (1872-73,
p. 75) of the Literary and Historical Society of
Quebec.</p>

<p>It has always been open to question from
whom came the first suggestion of the expedition
of 1745. The immediate incentive seems
to have been a belief, prompted by the reports
of prisoners released from Canso, that Louisbourg
could be captured, if attacked before relief
could reach it from France. Judge Robert Auchmuty,
of Roxbury, developed a plan for the capture
in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for July, 1745,&mdash;the
same number in which was also printed
the news of the attack and capture. When the
paper was reprinted in a thin folio tract shortly
afterwards, he or some one for him emphasized
his claim to the suggestion in the title itself as
follows: <i>The importance of Cape Breton to the
British Nation, humbly represented by Robert
Auckmuty</i> [sic], <i>Judge, &amp;c., in New England.
N. B. Upon the plan laid down in this representation
the island was taken by Commodore Warren
and General Pepperill the 14th of June, 1745</i>.

<p>It is claimed on behalf of William Vaughan
that he suggested the expedition to Governor
Wentworth, of New Hampshire, who in turn
referred him to Governor Shirley. An anonymous
tract, published in London in 1746, <i>The
Importance and Advantage of Cape Breton truly
stated and impartially considered</i>,<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> often assigned
to William Bollan, and believed by some to
have been inspired by Vaughan, says that
Vaughan had “the honor of reviving, at least,
if not of having been the original mover or projector,”
of the expedition, since it is claimed
that Lieutenant-Governor Clarke, of New York,<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>
had suggested the attack to the Duke of Newcastle
as early as 1743. Douglass (<i>Summary</i>,
etc., i. 348) says that Shirley was taken with the
“hint or conceit” of Vaughan, “a whimsical,
wild projector.” Hutchinson says that Vaughan
“was called the projector of the expedition,”
and Belknap accords him the priority in common
report.<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> When Thomas Prince came to dedicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
his sermon, preached on the Thanksgiving
day following the triumph, he inscribed it to Shirley
as the “principal former and promoter of
the expedition;” but the language hardly claims
the origination, though Shirley was generally
recognized as the moving spirit in its final determination.<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>The earliest account of this mettlesome enterprise,
which showed special research and opportunities,
was that of Dr. Belknap in his <i>History
of New Hampshire</i>, which was written in 1784,
less than forty years after the event, and when
he might have known some of the participants.
The most important of the <i>Pepperrell Papers</i>
had fallen into his hands, and he made good use
of them, after which he deposited them in the
cabinet of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
where they now are, bound in two volumes, covering
the years 1699-1779, but chiefly concerning
the Louisbourg expedition.</p>

<p>With them in the

Others of the scattered papers of Pepperrell
have since been found elsewhere. Dr.
Usher Parsons, in his <i>Life of Pepperrell</i>,<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> beside
using what Belknap possessed, sifted a
mass of papers found in an old shed on the
Pepperrell estate. This lot covered the years
1696-1759, and some of them were scarcely legible.
The mercantile letters and accounts among
them yielded little, but there was a smaller
body of Pepperrell’s own letters and those of
his correspondents, which proved of more or less
historical value.</p>

<p>Unremitting search yielded
gain to Dr. Parsons in other directions. Some
manuscripts coming from a Kittery house into
the hands of Capt. Luther Dame, of Newburyport,
were reported upon by Col. A. H. Hoyt
in the <i>New England Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>
(Oct., 1874, p. 451), in a paper afterwards reprinted
by him, separately, with revision; but
they throw no considerable light upon the Louisbourg
siege. They would add little to what
Parsons presents in chronologically arranged excerpts
from letters and other records which make
up his account of the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

<p>Of all other contemporary accounts and aids,
most, so far as known, have been put into print,
though George Bancroft quotes a journal of
Seth Pomeroy,<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> not yet in type; and there are
papers which might still be gleaned in the <i>Mass.
Archives</i>. There are in print the instructions
of Shirley, and a correspondence between Pepperrell
and Warren (<i>Mass. Hist. Collections</i>, i.
13-60); letters of Wentworth and Shirley on
the plan of attack, and other letters of Shirley
(<i>Provincial Papers of New Hampshire</i>, vol. v.
pp. 931, 949, etc.); and many others of Pepperrell,
Warren, Shirley, etc. (<i>Rhode Island Colonial
Records</i>, vol. v.). The <i>Colonial Records of Connecticut</i>
(vol. ix.) for this period give full details
of the legislative enactment regarding the part
that colony bore in the expedition; but the absence
of most of the illustrative documents from
her archives during that interval deprives us,
doubtless, of a correspondence similar to that
which is included in the Rhode Island printed
<i>Records</i>.</p>

<p>Shirley’s letters to Governor Thomas, of
Penna., respecting the preparations for the Louisbourg
expedition, are in <i>Penna. Archives</i>, i.
667, etc.</p>

<p>Stray letters and documents of some interest,
but throwing no essential light upon historical
events, are found in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.

<p>Various accounts of the siege, of no great extent
were published soon after its close. Chief
among them was an <i>Accurate journal and account
of the proceedings of the New England land
forces, during the late expedition against the French
settlements on Cape Breton to the time of the surrender
of Louisbourg</i>, Exon, 1746 (40 pp.). The
manuscript of this journal was sent to England
by Pepperrell to his friend Capt. Henry Stafford;
and as printed it was attested by Pepperrell,
Brig.-General Waldo, Col. Moore, Lieut.-Col.
Lothrop, and Lieut.-Col. Gridley.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> This journal
was printed, with some curious verbal differences,
as an appendix to a <i>Letter from William
Shirley, Esq., to the Duke of Newcastle, with a

It was by vote of the legislature, Dec. 30, 1746,

June 20, 1745, in Louisbourg harbor. Douglass
gives the force by sea and land before Louisbourg.

<p>A list of the commissioned officers of the expedition,
drawn from the <i>Belknap Papers</i>, is edited
by Charles Hudson in the <i>N. E. Hist. and

a list of 221 names of the common soldiers had
been printed; but in July, 1871, a much longer
enumeration is made out by Mr. Hudson from
the Pepperrell papers, the Council Records, and
other sources. Potter in the <i>N. H. Adj.-General’s
Report</i>, ii. (1866, pp. 61-76), afterwards
published as <i>Mil. Hist. of N. H.</i>, gives the New
Hampshire rolls of Louisbourg soldiers.</p>

<p>On the occasion of a Thanksgiving (July 18,
1745) in Boston, two sermons preserve to us
some additional if slight details. That of
Thomas Prince, <i>Extraordinary events the doings
of God and marvellous in pious eyes</i>, Boston and
London, 1745 (Harv. Coll. lib., 4375.42 and 43),
is mainly reprinted in S. G. Drake’s <i>Five Years’
French and Indian Wars</i>, p. 187; and that of
the Rev. Charles Chauncy, the brother-in-law of
Pepperrell, <i>Marvellous Things done by the right
hand and holy arm of God in getting him the victory</i>,
was printed both in Boston and London.<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The capture of Louisbourg and the question of
the disposition of the island at the peace led to
several expositions of its imagined value to the
British Crown, among which may be named:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The importance and advantage of Cape Breton
considered, in a letter to a member of Parliament
from an inhabitant of New England</i>, London,
1746. (Brinley, no. 69.) This is signed “Massachusettensis.”<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

<p><i>Two letters concerning some farther advantages
and improvements that may seem necessary to be
made on the taking and keeping of Cape Breton</i>,
London, 1746. (Carter-Brown, iii. no. 822.)</p>

<p><i>The importance and advantage of Cape Breton,
truly stated and impartially considered. With
proper maps</i>, London, 1746. (Carter-Brown, iii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
no. 823.) The maps follow those of Bellin in
Charlevoix. Its authorship is usually ascribed
to William Bollan. (Sabin, ii. 6,215.)</p>

<p><i>The great importance of Cape Breton demonstrated
and exemplified by extracts from the best
writers, French and English</i>, London, 1746. This
is a plea against the surrender of it to the French.
It is dedicated to Governor Shirley, and contains
Charlevoix’s map and plan. (Carter-Brown,
iii. no. 821.)</p>

<p><i>An accurate description of Cape Breton, Situation,
Soil, Ports, etc., its Importance to France, but
of how much greater it might have been to England;
with an account of the taking of the city
by the New England forces under General Pepperell
in 1745</i>, London, 1755.</p>

<p><i>Memoir of the principal transactions of the last
war between the English and French in North
America, from 1744 to the conclusion of the treaty
at Aix-la-Chapelle, containing in particular an
account of the importance of Nova Scotia and Cape
Breton to both nations</i> (3d ed., London, reprinted,
Boston, 1758.)</p>

<p>Douglass (<i>Summary</i>, etc.), the general historian
nearest the time, was an eager opponent
of Shirley, and in his account of the expedition
he ascribes to good luck the chief element in its
success. He calls it “this infinitely rash New
England Corporation adventure, though beyond
all military or human probability successful.”
(<i>Summary</i>, etc., 1751, ii. p. 11.) “Fortified
towns are hard nuts to crack, and your teeth
have not been accustomed to it,” wrote Benjamin
Franklin from Philadelphia to his brother
in Boston. (<i>Franklin’s Works</i>, vii. 16.)<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a></p>

<p>Accounts of the expedition enter necessarily
into the more general narratives, like those of
Hutchinson (<i>Mass. Bay</i>); Chalmers (<i>Revolt</i>,
etc.); Minot (<i>Massachusetts</i>); Gordon (<i>Amer.
Rev.</i>); Marshall (<i>Washington</i>); Bancroft (<i>United
States</i>); Grahame (<i>United States</i>); Williamson
(<i>Hist. of Maine</i>); Murdoch (<i>Nova Scotia</i>, ii. ch.
5); Haliburton (<i>Nova Scotia</i>); Stone (<i>Sir Wm.
Johnson</i>, vol. i.); Palfrey (<i>Compendious Hist. of
New England</i>, iv. ch. 9); Bury (<i>Exodus of the
Western Nations</i>, ii. ch. 6); Gay (<i>Pop. Hist. United
States</i>); Drake (<i>Boston</i>). The <i>Memorial Hist.
Boston</i> (ii. 117) and Barry’s <i>Massachusetts</i> (ii.
140, etc.) give numerous references. Joel T.
Headley has a popular narrative in <i>Harper’s
Monthly</i>, xxviii. p. 354. Garneau (<i>Hist. du Canada</i>,
4th ed., ii. 190) offers the established French
account. Cf. <i>Lettre d’un habitant de Louisbourg
contenant une relation exacte de la prise de l’Ile
Royale par les Anglais</i>, Quebec, 1745. (Sabin,
x. no. 40,671.)<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></p>

<p>The present condition of the site of Louisbourg
is described by Parsons (<i>Life of Pepperrell</i>,
332); by Parkman (<i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>); by
J. G. Bourinot in his “The old forts of Acadia”
in <i>Canadian Monthly</i>, v. 369; and in the <i>Canadian
Antiquarian</i>, iv. 57.</p>

<p class="p2">Maps, both French and English, showing the
fortifications and harbor of Louisbourg are numerous.</p>

<p>Both editions of Charlevoix’s <i>Histoire de la
Nouvelle France</i>, the duodecimo in six volumes,
and the quarto in three volumes issued in 1744,
the year before the siege, have plans of Louisbourg
and its fortifications, and the same are
reproduced in Dr. Shea’s translation of Charlevoix.
They are the work of Nicholas Bellin, and
to the same draughtsman belongs <i>Le Petit Atlas
Maritime</i>, 1764, in the volume of which devoted
to North America, there are other (nos. 23, 24)
plans of the harbor and fortifications.</p>

<p>Following French sources is a <i>Plan des fortifications
de Louisbourg</i>, published at Amsterdam
by H. de Leth about 1750. A “Plan special de
Louisbourg” is also to be found on the map published
by N. Visscher at Amsterdam, called
“<i>Carte Nouvelle contenant la partie de l’Amérique
la plus septentrionale</i>.”</p>

<p>Among the French maps is one “levé en
1756,” after a plan of Louisbourg, preserved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the Dépôt des Cartes de la Marine in Paris. This
appeared in 1779 in the <i>Neptune Americo-Septentrional</i>,
“publiée par ordre du Roi;” and another,
dated 1758, “levé par le ch<sup>ev.</sup> de la Rigaudiere,”
was accompanied by a view, of which
there is a copy in the <i>Mass. Archives; Docs. collected
in France, Atlas</i>, ii. 5. In this last (composite)
Atlas (ii. nos. 44, 45) are maps of the
town and harbor, and a large plan of the fortifications,
marked “Tome i. no. 23,” which can
probably be identified.</p>

        <p class="pf400">A reduced sketch from a painting owned by Mrs. Anna H. C. Howard of Brooklyn, N. Y., which came
to her by descent from Sir William Pepperrell. The canvas is very dark and obscure, and the artist may
have missed some of the details, particularly of the walls along the shore. The point of view seems to be
from the northwest side of the interior harbor, near the bridge (seen in the foreground), which spans one
of the little inlets, as shown in some of the maps. This position is near what are called “Hale’s Barracks”
in the draft of the town and harbor on the preceding page. The dismantled ships along the opposite shore
are apparently the French fleet, while an English ship is near the bridge.</p>

<p class="pf400">The following letter describes the present condition of the ground:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq wn">

<p class="pr4 p1"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, June 4, 1886.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Winsor</span>,&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to comply with your request, and to give my recollections
of Louisburg as seen in September last.</p>

<p>The historical town of that name, or rather the ruin of the old fortress, lies perhaps three miles from the
modern town, which is a small village, situated on the northeasterly side of the bay or harbor. The inhabitants
of the neighborhood live, for the most part, by fishing and other business connected with that branch of industry,
eking out their livelihood by the cultivation of a rocky and barren soil. The road from the village to the
old fortress runs along the western shore of the bay, passing at intervals the small houses of the fishermen
and leaving on the left the site of the Royal Battery, which is still discernible. This was the first outpost of
the French taken at the siege, and its gallant capture proved subsequently to be of the greatest service to the
English. From this point the ruins of the fortress begin to loom up and show their real character. Soon
the walls are reached, and the remains of the former bastions on the land side are easily recognized. This
land front is more than half a mile in length, and stretches from the sea on the left to the bay on the right,
forming a line of works that would seem to be impregnable to any and all assaults. From its crown a good
idea can be gained of the size of the fortifications, which extend in its entire circuit more than a mile and
a half in length, and inclose an area of a hundred and twenty acres, more or less. The public buildings within
the fortress were of stone, and, with the help of a guide, their sites can easily be made out. The burying-ground,
on the point of land to the eastward, where hundreds of bodies were buried, is still shown; and the
sheep and cattle graze all unconscious of the great deeds that have been done in the neighborhood. Taken
all in all, the place is full of the most interesting associations, and speaks of the period when the sceptre of
power in America was balancing between France and England; and Louisburg forms to-day the grandest
ruin in this part of the continent.</p>

<p>It follows an English plan procured by
Mr. Bancroft in London, and closely resembles
the sketch owned by a descendant of Pepperrell,
and herewith given. Haliburton in his <i>History
of Nova Scotia</i> gives a similar plan, as well as a
draught of the harbor. The plan of the town and
the vicinity which is given by Brown in his <i>Cape
Breton</i> is also reproduced herewith. The earliest
of the more elaborate charts of the harbor
is that published by Des Barres in Oct., 1781.
We find a rude sketch of the Island battery in
<i>Curwen’s Journal</i> as edited by Ward (Boston,
4th ed. 1864), which was sent by that observer
from Louisbourg, July 25, 1745. A reproduction
of this sketch, herewith given, needs the following

<p>Shirley (June 3, 1749) writes to Gov. Wentworth
that he had agreed with nine Indian
chiefs, then in Boston, to hold a conference at
Casco bay, Sept. 27. (<i>N. H. Prov. Papers</i>, v.
127.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile the English government, in pursuance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
of an effort to anglicize the peninsula,<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
had planned the transportation to Nova Scotia
of an equipped colony under Edward Cornwallis,
which arrived at Chebucto harbor in the
summer of 1749, and founded Halifax. A treaty
with the Indians was held there Aug. 15, 1749.
(<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, ix. 220.) There is a full-size
fac-simile of the document in Akins’s <i>Public Doc.
of Nova Scotia</i>. It was in confirmation of the
Boston treaty of Dec. 15, 1725, which is embodied
in the new treaty.</p>

<p>Another treaty with the eastern Indians was
made at Falmouth, Oct. 16, 1749. (<i>Mass. Archives</i>,
xxix. 427; xxxiv.; <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, ix.

<p>There was another conference with the Penobscots
and Norridgewocks, Aug. 3-8, 1750.
(<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxix. 429.)</p>

<p>A tract to encourage emigration to the new
colony at Halifax was printed in London in 1750,
and reprinted in Dublin: <i>A genuine account of
Nova Scotia, to which is added his majesty’s proposals
as an encouragement to those who are willing
to settle there</i>. Cf. the German tract: <i>Historische

the colony’s help, appeared in John Wilson’s

<p>There are papers relating to the first settlement
of Halifax in Akins’s <i>Documents</i>, 495; and
a paper on the first council meeting at Halifax,
by T. B. Akins, in the <i>Nova Scotia Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>,
vol. ii. See also Murdoch’s <i>Nova Scotia</i>, ii. ch. 11.
Various maps of Halifax and the
harbor were made during the
subsequent years. The <i>Catalogue
of the king’s maps</i> (i. 483) in the
British Museum shows several
manuscript draughts. A small
engraved plan was published in
the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, 1750,
p. 295. A large map, dedicated to the Earl of
Halifax, is called: <i>Carte du havre de Chibucto

<p>A smaller <i>Plan des havens von Chebucto und

1751. Jefferys issued a large <i>Chart of the Harbor
of Halifax</i>, 1759, which was repeated in his
<i>General Topography of North America and West
Indies</i>, London, 1768. A “Plan de la Baye de
Chibouctou nommée par les Anglois Halifax,”
bears date 1763. Another is in the <i>Set of plans
and forts</i> (No. 7) published in London in 1763.
In the Des Barres series of coast charts of a
later period (1781) there is a large draft of the
harbor, with colored marginal views of the coast.</p>

but not until the houses and barns of neighboring
settlers had been burned, with the aim of
compelling the Acadians to fly to the French for
shelter and sustenance.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> The French now began
a fort on the Beauséjour hill. A petty warfare
and reprisals, not unmixed with treachery,
became chronic, and were well set off with a
background of more portentous rumors.<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> It happened
that letters crossed each other, or nearly
so, passing between Lawrence (now governor)
and Shirley, suggesting an attack on Beauséjour.
So the conquest was easily planned. Shirley
commissioned Col. John Winslow to raise 2,000
men, and but for delay in the arrival of muskets
from England this force would have cast anchor
near Fort Lawrence on the first of
May instead of the first of June.
Monckton, a regular officer, who had
been Lawrence’s agent on the Boston
mission, held the general command
over Winslow, a provincial
officer. The fort surrendered before
the siege trains got fairly to work.
Parkman, who gives a vivid picture
of the confusion of the French, refers for his authorities
to the <i>Mémoires sur le Canada</i>, 1749-1760;
Pichon’s <i>Cape Breton</i>, and the journal of
Pichon, as cited by Murdoch in his<i> Hist. of Nova
Scotia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> The captured fort became Fort Cumberland;
Fort Gaspereau, on the other side of
the isthmus, surrendered without a blow. Rouse,
the Boston privateersman, who had commanded
the convoy from Boston, was sent to capture the
fort at the mouth of the St. John, and the Indians,
whom the French had deserted on Rouse’s
approach, joyfully welcomed him.</p>

<p>With the documentary
evidence now in hand, chiefly the records
of the French themselves, we can clearly see the
condition which the English rather suspected
than knew in detail.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> They indeed were aware
that the neutrals of Chignecto in 1750 had been
in effect coerced to crossing the lines at the neck,
while the burning of their houses and barns had
been accomplished to prevent their return. They
further knew that this gave an increased force of
desperate and misguided men to be led by priests
like Le Loutre, and encouraged by the French
commanders, acting under orders of the central
government at Quebec. They had good reason
to suspect, what was indeed the fact, that the
emissaries of the Catholic church and the civil
powers in Canada were confident in the use they
could in one way and another make of the mass
of Acadians, though still nominally subjects of
the British king.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> Their loyalty had always
been a qualified one. A reservation of not being
obliged to serve in war against the French had
been in the past allowed in their oath; but such
reservation had not been approved by the Crown,
though it had not been practically disallowed.
It was a reservation which in the present conjunction
of affairs Governor Lawrence thought
it inexpedient to allow, and he required an unqualified
submission by oath. He had already
deprived them of their arms. The oath was persistently
refused and the return of their arms
demanded. This act was in itself ominous. The
British plans had by this time miscarried in New
York and Pennsylvania, and under Braddock
the forces had suffered signal defeat. The terms
of the New England troops in Acadia were fast
expiring. With these troops withdrawn, and others
of the Acadian garrisons sent to succor the
defeated armies farther west, and with the Canadian
government prompted to make the most of
the disaffection toward the English and of the
loyalty to the French flag which existed within
the peninsula, there could hardly have been a
hope of the retention of the country under the
British flag, unless something could be done to
neutralize the evil of harboring an enemy.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> “In
fact,” says Parkman, “the Acadians, while calling
themselves neutrals, were an enemy encamped
in the heart of the province.”<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> Colonel Higginson
(<i>Larger History</i>, etc.) presents the antithesis
in a milder form, when he says, “They were
as inconvenient as neighbors as they are now
picturesque in history.” It has been claimed
that the cruelty of deportation might have been
avoided by exacting hostages of the Acadians.
That involves confidence in the ability of an abjectly
priest-ridden people to resist the threats of
excommunication, should at any time the emissaries
of Quebec find it convenient to sacrifice
the hostages to secure success to the French
arms. Under such a plan the English might too
late learn that military execution upon the hostages
was a likely accompaniment of a military
disaster which it would not avert. The alternative
of deportation was much surer, and self-preservation
naturally sought the securest means.
Simply to drive the Acadians from the country
would have added to the reckless hordes allured
by the French in 1750, which had fraternized
with the Micmacs, and harassed the English
settlements. To deport them, and scatter them
among the other provinces, so that they could
not combine, was a safer and, as they thought,
the only certain way to destroy the Acadians as
a military danger. It was a terrible conclusion,
and must not be confounded with possible errors
in carrying out the plan. The council, taking
aid from the naval commanders, decided upon it.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>The decision and its execution have elicited
opinions as diverse as the characters of those
who have the tender and the more rigid passions
mixed in them in different degrees. The question,
however, is simply one of necessity in war
to be judged by laws which exclude a gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>

<p>Writers of the compassionate school have
naturally sought to heighten the enormity of the
measure by pictures of the guilelessness of the
people, who were the sufferers. It was not long
after the event when the Abbé Raynal played
upon such sympathetic responses in his description<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>
of the Acadians, setting forth an ideal
simplicity and content to which Longfellow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
his <i>Evangeline</i> has added the unbounded charms
of his verse. That the Acadians were a prolific
people might argue content, but Hannay
(<i>Acadia</i>, ch. xvi.), who best traces their mutations
and growth, shows evidences that this
fruitfulness had not been without some admixture,
at least, with the Micmacs.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> Though it is
the usual assertion that bastardy was almost
unknown among them, Hannay adduces testimony
to their licentiousness which he deems
sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> We may pick out the most opposite
views regarding the comforts of their daily life.
A French authority describes their houses as
“wretched wooden boxes, without ornament or
convenience;”<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> but George Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> and
many others tell us, after the Raynal ideal, that
these same houses were “neatly constructed and
comfortably furnished.”</p>

<p>A simple people usually find it easy to vary
the monotony of their existence by bickerings
and litigations; and if we may believe the French
authorities whom Hannay quotes, the Acadians
were no exception to the rule, which makes up
for the absence of excitements in a diversified
life by a counterbalance of such evils as mix and
obscure the affections of society.</p>

<p>Their religious training prompted them to
place their priests in the same scale of infallibility
with their Maker, while the machinations of
Le Loutre<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> ensnared them and became, quite
as much as that “scrupulous sense of the indissoluble
nature of their ancient obligation to
their king,”<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> a great cause of their misfortunes.
To glimpses of the character of the Acadians
which we get in the published documents, French
and English, of their own day, we can add but
few estimates of observers who were certainly
writing for the eye of the public. There is a
rather whimsical, but, as Parkman thinks, a faithful
description of them, earlier in the century, to
be found in the <i>Relation</i> of Diéreville.</p>

<p>Let us now observe some of the mutations of
opinion to which allusion has been made. Gov.
Lawrence, in his circular letter to the other colonies,
naturally set forth the necessity of the case
in justification. Edmund Burke, not long after,
judged the act a most inhumane one, and “we
did,” he says, “upon pretences not worth a farthing,
root out this poor, innocent, deserving
people, whom our utter inability to govern or to
reconcile gave us no sort of right to extirpate.”
But this was in the guise of a running commentary
from a party point of view, and in ignorance
of much now known. The French, English,
and American historians nearest the event take
divergent positions. Raynal started the poetic
ideal, to which reference has been made. It
must not be forgotten, however, that the Abbé
had a purpose in his picture, aiming as he did
to set off by a foil the condition of the French
peasantry at a period preceding the French Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>
Entick<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> commends the measure, but
not the method of its execution. A pamphlet
published in London in 1765, setting forth the
sacrifices of the province during the French and
Indian wars, referring to the deportation, says:
“This was a most wise step,” but the exiles
“have been and still remain a heavy bill of
charge to this province.”<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> Hutchinson<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> simply
allows that the authors of the movement supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
that self-preservation was its sufficient excuse.
When Minot<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> surveyed the subject, he was quite
as chary of an opinion. He probably felt, as indeed
was the case, that no one at that time had
access to the documents on which a safe judgment
could be based. The first distinct defence
of the English came when Raynal’s views were
printed, in translation, in Nova Scotia in 1791.
Secretary Bulkely and Judge Deschamps now
published a vindication of the English government,
but it was necessarily inadequate in the
absence of proof. It served not much purpose,
however, in diverting the general opinion
from the channels of compassion. In 1787, the
Rev. Andrew Brown, a Scotchman, was called
to settle over a church in Halifax. He remained
till 1795, when he returned to Scotland,
where he lived till 1834, a part of the time occupying
the chair of rhetoric in the University of
Edinburgh, which had been previously filled by
Dr. Blair. During his sojourn in Nova Scotia,
and down to so late a period as 1815, he collected
materials for a history of the province. His
papers, including original documents, were discovered
serving ignoble purposes in a grocer’s
shop in Scotland, and bought for the collections
of the British Museum. Transcripts from the
most interesting of them relating to the expulsion
of the Acadians have been made at the instance
of the Nova Scotia Record Commission,
and have been printed in the second volume
of the <i>Collections</i> of the Nova Scotia Historical
Society. They consist of letters and statements
from people whom Brown had known, and
who had taken part in the expulsion, with other
contemporary papers regarding the condition
of the Acadians just previous to their removal.
Brown’s own opinion of the act classed it,
for atrocity, with the massacre of St. Bartholomew.</p>

<p>Robert Walsh, in his <i>Appeal from the Judgment
of Great Britain</i> (2d ed. 1819, p. 86), says:
“It has always appeared to me that the reason
of state was never more cheaply urged or more
odiously triumphant than on this occasion.” He
follows Minot in his account.</p>

<p>Judge Thomas C. Haliburton approached the
subject when he might have known, among the
very old people of the province, some whose
earliest recollections went back to the event, or
to its train of succeeding incidents. Haliburton’s
sympathy is unmistakably aroused, and failing to
find in the records of the secretary’s office at Halifax
any traces of the deportation, his deduction
is that the particulars were carefully concealed.
For such an act he finds no reason, save that the
parties were, “as in truth they well might be,”
ashamed of the transaction. “I have therefore,”
he adds, “had much difficulty in ascertaining the
facts.” He seems to have depended almost
wholly upon Hutchinson, Raynal, and Minot,
and through the latter he got track of the journal
of Winslow. Haliburton’s <i>Nova Scotia</i> was published
in 1829,<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> and Hutchinson’s third volume
had only the year before (1828) been printed in
England from his manuscript. Of Winslow’s
journal he seems to have made but restricted
use.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> Haliburton’s allegations in respect to the
archives of Halifax were founded on a misconception.
The papers which he sought in vain
in fact existed, but were stored away in boxes,
and the archive-keepers of Haliburton’s day apparently
had little idea of their importance. A
recent writer (Smith’s <i>Acadia</i>, p. 164) hastily infers
that this careless disposition of them was
intentional. Parkman says that copies of the
council records were sent at the time to England
and are now in the Public Record Office;
but it does not appear that Haliburton sought
them; and had he done so, if we may judge from
the printed copy which we now have of them, he
would have discovered no essential help between
July, 1755, and January, 1756. It was not till
1857 that the legislative assembly of Nova Scotia
initiated a movement for completing and arranging
the archives at Halifax, and for securing in
addition copies of documents at London and
Quebec,&mdash;the latter being in fact other copies
from papers in the archives at Paris.</p>

<p>Between 1857 and 1864, Thomas B. Akins,
Esq., acting as record commissioner of the
province, bound and arranged, as appears by his
<i>Report</i> of Feb. 24, 1864, and deposited in the
legislative library of the province, over 200 volumes
of historical papers. The most important
of these volumes for other than the local historian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
and covering the period of the present volume
appear to be the following:&mdash;</p>

Annapolis, 1714-48; and to the governor at Halifax,

<p class="p1">But before this arranging of the Halifax Archives
was undertaken, Bancroft in his <i>United
States</i><a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> had used language which he has allowed
to stand during successive revisions: “I know
not if the annals of the human race keep the
records of sorrows so wantonly inflicted, so bitter
and so perennial, as fell upon the French inhabitants
of Acadia.” About the same time the
Canadian historian, Garneau,<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> simply quotes
the effusions of Raynal. The publication of
the <i>Neutral French</i>, by Catharine R. Williams,
in 1841, a story in which the writer’s interest in
the sad tale had grown with her study of the
subject on the spot,<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> followed by the <i>Evangeline</i>
of Longfellow in 1847, which readily compelled
attention, drew many eyes upon the records
which had been the basis of these works of fiction.
The most significant judgment, in consequence,
made in America was that of the late
President Felton, of Harvard University, in the
<i>North American Review</i> (Jan., 1848, p. 231),
wherein he called the deportation “a most tyrannical
exercise of superior force, resting for
its justification not upon sufficient proofs, but
upon an alleged inevitable state necessity.” This
gave direction to current belief.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> Barry (<i>Massachusetts</i>,
ii. 200) wrote as if Raynal had compassed
the truth. <i>Chambers’ Journal</i> (xxii. 342,
or <i>Living Age</i>, xliv. 51) called an article on the
subject “The American Glencoe.” In 1862,
Mr. Robert Grant Haliburton, a son of Judge
Haliburton, gave token of a new conception in
the outline of a defence for the British government,
which he drew in an address, <i>The Past
and the Future of Nova Scotia</i> (Halifax, 1862).
A more thorough exposition was at hand. Mr.
Akins had been empowered to prepare for publication
a selection of the more important papers
among those which he had been arranging. In
1869 a volume of <i>Selections</i>, etc., appeared. In
his preface Mr. Akins says: “Although much
has been written on the subject, yet until lately
it has undergone little actual investigation, and
in consequence the necessity for their removal
has not been clearly perceived, and the motives
which led to its enforcement have been often
misunderstood.” The views which he enforces
are in accord with this remark. Mr. W. J. Anderson
followed up this judgment in the <i>Transactions</i><a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>
of the Literary and Historical Society
of Quebec, and termed the act “a dreadful
necessity.” The old view still lingered. It was
enforced by Célestin Moreau in his <i>Histoire de
l’Acadie Françoise de 1598 à 1755</i> (Paris, 1873),
and Palfrey, in the <i>Compendious Hist. of New
England</i> (1873), which carried on the story of his
larger volumes, leaves his adhesion to a view adverse
to the English to be inferred. As to the
character of the Acadians, while he allows for
“a dash of poetry” in the language of Raynal,
he mainly adopts it.<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1879 Mr. James Hannay, perceiving the
necessity of a well-ordered history, to embody
in more readable shape the vast amount of material
which Beamish Murdoch in his <i>History
of Nova Scotia</i><a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> had thrown into the form of
annals, published his <i>History of Acadia from its
first discovery to its surrender to England by the
Treaty of Paris</i> (St. John, N. B., 1879). Hannay
embodied in this book the most elaborate account
which had yet been written of the deportation,
and referring to it in his preface he says: “Very
few people who follow the story to the end will
be prepared to say that it was not a necessary
measure of self-preservation on the part of the
English authorities in Nova Scotia.”</p>

<p>Still the old sympathies were powerful. Henry
Cabot Lodge in his <i>Short History of the English
Colonies</i><a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> (1881) finds the Acadians “harmless.”
Hannay’s investigations were not lost,
however, on Dr. George E. Ellis, who in his
<i>Red Man and White Man in North America</i>
(Boston, 1882) prefigured the results which two
years later were to be adduced by Parkman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Philip H. Smith published at
Pawling, N. Y., a book, doubly his own, for he
inserted in it rude wood-cuts of his own graving.
The book, which was coarsely printed on an old
Liberty job press, was
called <i>Acadia, a lost chapter
in American history</i>,&mdash;why
lost is not apparent,
in view of the
extensive literature of
the subject. He refers
vaguely to fifty authorities,
but without giving
us the means to track
him among them, as he
in an uncompromising way condemns the course
of the British government. He is found, however,
to draw largely from Judge Haliburton,
and to adopt that writer’s assertion of the loss
or abstraction of records. A few months later
Mr. Parkman published the first volume of
his <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>, using some material,
particularly from the French Archives, which
his predecessors had not possessed.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> In referring
to the deportation, he says that its causes
have not been understood<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> by those who follow
or abet the popular belief. Though he does not
suggest any alternative action, he sets forth
abundantly the reasons which palliate and explain
a measure “too harsh and indiscriminate
to be wholly justified.”<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Widely different statements as to the number
of those deported have been made. Lawrence in
his circular letter,<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> addressed (Aug. 11, 1755) to
the governors of the English colonies, says that
about 7,000 is the number to be distributed, and
it is probably upon his figures that the Lords of
Trade in addressing the king, Dec. 20, 1756, place
the number at near 7,000. “Not less than 6,000 at
least” is the language of a contemporary letter.<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>
That these figures were approximately correct
would appear from the English records, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
foot up together for the several centres of the
movement&mdash;Beaubassin, Fort Edward, Minas,
and Annapolis&mdash;a little over 6,000, as Parkman
shows. The Canadian government in making a
retrospective census in 1876, figured the number
of Acadians within the peninsula in 1755 at 8,200.
In giving 18,000 as the number of Acadians in
1755, Haliburton must have meant to include all
of that birth in the maritime provinces, for he
accepts Lawrence’s statement that 7,000 were
deported. P. H. Smith<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> uses these figures
(18,000) so loosely that he seems to believe that
all but a few hundred of them were removed.
Rameau, a recent French authority, makes the
number 6,000.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> Hannay, a late New Brunswick
writer, allows only 3,000, but this number
seems to have been reached by ignoring some
part of the four distinct movements, as conducted
by Monckton, Winslow, Murray, and Handfield.
Minot accepts this same 3,000, and he is followed
by Gay in the <i>Popular Hist. of the United
States</i>, and by Ellis in his <i>Red Man and White
Man in North America</i>.</p>

<p>Gov. Lawrence agreed with some Boston merchants,
Apthorp and Hancock, to furnish the
transports for conveying the exiles away.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> These
contractors furnished the necessary flour, bread,
pork, and beef for the service. The delay of
the vessels to arrive seems to have arisen from
Lawrence’s not giving timely notice to the contractors,
for fear that the Acadians might learn
of the intention.<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> Winslow had told those who
came under his supervision, that he would do
everything in his power to transport “whole
families in the same vessel.” Parkman thinks
(i. 279) that the failures in this respect were not
numerous. Smith, with little regard for the confusion
which the tardy arrival of the transports
occasioned, thinks they indicate that Winslow
violated his word as a soldier. One of the actors
in the movement, as reported in the Brown
Papers (<i>Nova Scotia Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, ii. 131),
says that “he fears some families were divided,
notwithstanding all possible care was taken to
prevent it.”</p>

<p>Hutchinson (iii. 40) says: “Five or six families
were brought to Boston, the wife and children
only, without the husbands and fathers, who
by advertisements in the newspapers came from
Philadelphia to Boston, being till then utterly
uncertain what had become of their families.”</p>

<p>Miss Caulkins (<i>New London</i>, p. 469) says more
were landed at New London than at any other
New England port. The <i>Connecticut Colony Records</i>
(vol. x. pp. 452, 461, 615) show how the
Acadians were distributed throughout the towns,
and that some were brought there from Maryland.</p>

<p>The journals of the House of Representatives
in Massachusetts (1755-56) note the official action
which was taken in that province respecting
them. There are two volumes in the <i>Mass. Archives</i>
(vols. xxiii., xxiv.) marked “French Neutrals,”
which explain that for fifteen years (1755-1769)
the charge of their support entered more or
less into the burdens of the towns among which
they were then scattered.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> A committee was in
charge of benefactions which were bestowed
upon them, and papers relating to their doings
make part of the collection of old documents in
the Charity Building in Boston.</p>

<p>Hutchinson (iii. 40), who had personal knowledge
of the facts, says of their sojourn in Massachusetts:
“Many of them went through great
hardships; but in general they were treated with
humanity.” He also tells us (iii. 41) that he interested
himself in drafting for them a petition
to the English king to be allowed to return to
their lands or to be paid for them; but they refused
to sign it, on the ground that they would
thereby be cut off from the sympathy of the
French king.</p>

<p>When in the spring of 1756 Major Jedediah
Preble returned with some of the New England
troops to Boston, he was directed by Lawrence
to stop at Cape Sable and seize such Acadians
as he could find.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> Though Smith (p. 252) says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
he did not see fit to obey the order, a letter from
him, dated April 24, 1756, printed in the <i>N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1876, p. 19, shows that he
carried out the order and burnt the houses.
When these newer exiles arrived at Boston, the
provincial authorities declined to receive them.
A vessel was hired to convey them to North Carolina,
but the captives refused (May 8, 1756) to
reëmbark. (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 18.) In 1762 the work of
deportation was still going on, and five more
transports arrived in Boston, but these seem
largely to have been gathered outside the peninsula.
They were returned by the Massachusetts
authorities to Halifax, with the approval of
the Lords of Trade and General Amherst, who
thought there was no longer occasion to continue
the deportation.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i> of Sept. 4, 1755,
the day before the action of Winslow at Minas,
informed that province of the intended action in
Nova Scotia. The exiles were hardly welcome
when they came. Governor Morris wrote to
Shirley (<i>Penna. Archives</i>, ii. 506; <i>Col. Rec.</i>, vi.
712) that he had no money to devote to their
support, and that he should be obliged to retain,
for guarding them, some recruits which he had
raised for the field.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> There were kind people,
however, in Philadelphia, of kindred blood,
among the descendants of Huguenot emigrants,
and their attention to the distresses of the exiles
renders it possible for Akins to say: “They appear
to have received better treatment at the
hands of the government of Philadelphia than
was accorded to them in some of the other provinces.”
(<i>Select. from Pub. Docs. of Nova Scotia</i>,
p. 278.) Haliburton (i. 183), averred that the
proposition was made in Pennsylvania to sell
the neutrals into slavery. Mr. William B. Reed,
in a paper on “The Acadian exiles, or French
neutrals in Pennsylvania (1755-57),” published
in Memoirs (vol. vi. p. 283) of the Penna. Hist.
Soc.,<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> refutes the assertion. The poor people
seem to have had less fear of provoking the
ill-will of France than their brethren in Massachusetts
had shown, and a petition to the king
of Great Britain is preserved, apparently indited
for them, as Robert Walsh, Jr., in his <i>Appeal
from the Judgment of Great Britain respecting
the United States</i> (Philadelphia, 1829, p. 437),
printed it “from a draft in the handwriting of
Benezet,” one of the Philadelphia Huguenots. It
is reprinted in the appendix of Smith’s <i>Acadia</i>
(p. 369). Another document is preserved to us
in <i>A Relation of the Misfortunes of the French
Neutrals as laid before the Assembly of the Province
of Pennsylvania by John Baptist Galerm, one
of the said People</i>. It constitutes a broadside
extra of the Pennsylvania Gazette of about February,
1756,&mdash;the document being dated Feb.
11. It sets forth the history of their troubles,
but did not specifically ask for assistance, which
was, however, granted when the neutrals were
apportioned among the counties. It is reprinted
in the <i>Memoirs</i> (vi. 314) of the Penna. Hist.
Soc., in Smith’s <i>Acadia</i> (p. 378), and in <i>Penna.
Archives</i>; iii. 565. Walsh (p. 90) says that, notwithstanding
charitable attentions, more than
half of those in Pennsylvania died in a short
time.</p>

<p>Daniel Dulany, writing of the Acadians arriving
in Maryland in 1755, says that they insist
on being treated as prisoners of war,&mdash;thereby
claiming to be no subjects. “They have almost
eat us up,” he adds; “as there is no provision
for them, they have been supported by private
subscription. Political considerations may make
this [the deportation] a prudent step, for anything
I know, and perhaps their behavior may
have deservedly brought their sufferings upon
them; but ‘t is impossible not to compassionate
their distress.”<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a></p>

<p>In Virginia Governor Dinwiddie received
them with alarm, at a time when their countrymen
were scalping the settlers on the western
frontiers. He seemed to suppose from Lawrence’s
letter that 5,000 were coming, but only
1,140 actually arrived. He writes that they
proved lazy and contentious, and caballed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
the slaves, and tried to run away with a sloop
at Hampton. He managed to maintain them
till the assembly met, when he recommended
that provision should be made for their support;
but the clamor against them throughout the colony
was so great that the legislature directed
their reshipment to England at a cost of £5,000.
When Governor Glen, of Carolina, sent fifty
more of them to Virginia, Dinwiddie sent them
north.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p>In the Carolinas and Georgia they were not
more welcome. Jones<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> says that the 400 received
in Georgia went scattering away. Dinwiddie
reports<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> that in these southern colonies
vessels were given them, and that at one time
several hundreds of them were coasting north in
vessels and canoes, so that the shores of the Dominion
were opened to their descents for provision
as they voyaged northward. When Dinwiddie
sent a sloop after some who had been heard
of near the capes, they eluded the search. When
Lawrence learned of this northern coursing, he
sent another circular letter to the continental
governors, begging them to intercept the exiles
and destroy their craft.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> Some such destruction
did take place on the Massachusetts coast,<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> and
others were intercepted on the shores of Long
Island.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>In Louisiana many of them ultimately found
a permanent home, and 50,000 “Cajeans,” as
they are vulgarly called, constitute to-day a separate
community along the “Acadian coast” of
the Mississippi, in the western parts of the State.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>
After the peace and during the next few years
they wandered thither through different channels:
some came direct from the English colonies,<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>
others from Santo Domingo, and still
others passed down the Mississippi from Canada,
where their reception had been even worse
than in the English colonies.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

<p>Until recent years have given better details,
the opinions regarding the ultimate fate of most
of the Acadians have remained erroneous. So
little did Hutchinson know of it that he speaks
(iii. 42) of their being in a manner extinct, the few
which remained being mixed with other subjects
in different parts of the French dominions. Later
New England writers have not been better informed.
Hildreth (<i>United States</i>, ii. 459) says
that “the greater part, spiritless, careless, helpless,
died in exile.” Barry (ii. 204) says, “They
became extinct, though a few of their descendants,
indeed, still live at the South!” The later
Nova Scotia authorities have come nearer the
truth. Murdoch says very many of them returned
within a few years. Rameau, in his <i>Une
Colonie féodale</i>, speaks of 150 families from New
England wandering back by land. Some of them,
pushing on past their old farms, reached the bay
of St. Mary’s, and founded the villages which
their descendants now occupy. Those which
returned, joined to such as had escaped the hunt
of the English, counted 2,500, and in 1871 their
numbers had increased to 87,740 souls. Rameau,
in an earlier work, <i>La France aux Colonies:
Études sur le développement de la race française
hors de l’Europe: Les Français en Amérique,
Acadiens et Canadiens</i> (Paris, 1859), had
reached the same conclusion (p. 93) about the
entire number of Acadians within the peninsula
(16,000) as already mentioned, and held that
while 6,000 were deported (p. 144), about 9,000
escaped the proscription (p. 62). He traces
their wanderings and enumerates the dispersed
settlements.</p>

<p>A more recent writer, Hannay (pp. 406, 408),
says: “The great bulk of the Acadians, however,
finally succeeded in returning to the land
of their birth.... At least two thirds of the
3,000 (?) removed eventually returned.”</p>

<p>The guide-books and a chapter in Smith’s
<i>Acadia</i> tell of the numerous settlements now
existing along the Madawaska River, partly in
New Brunswick and partly in Maine, which are
the villages of the progeny of such as fled to
the St. John, and removed to these upper waters
of that river when, after the close of the American
Revolution, they retired before the influx of
the loyalists which settled in the neighborhood
of the present city of St. John.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Franquet, who a year or two before the war
began was sent by the French to strengthen
Louisbourg and inspect the defences of Canada,

<p>Admiral Knowles, in the memorial for back
pay which he presented in 1774 to the British
government, claimed the credit of having planned
the movements for this second capture of Louisbourg.</p>

<p>The most authoritative contemporary account
of the siege of 1758, on the English side, is contained
in the despatches of Amherst and Boscawen
sent to Pitt, extracts from which were published
as <i>A journal of the landing of his majesty’s
forces on the island of Cape Breton, and
of the siege and surrender of Louisbourg</i> (22 pp.).

Amherst was printed in the <i>London
Magazine</i>, and is included in
Thomas Mante’s <i>Hist. of the Late
War in North America</i> (London,

<p>Of the contemporary French accounts,
Parkman says he had before
him four long and minute diaries
of the siege. The first is that
of Drucour, the French commander,
containing his correspondence
with Amherst, Boscawen, and
Desgouttes, the naval chief of
the French. Tourville, who commanded
the “Capricieux,” one of
the French fleet, kept a second of
these diaries. A third and fourth
are without the names of their
writers. They agree in nearly all
essential particulars.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> The <i>Parkman
MSS.</i>, in the Mass. Hist. Society’s

from participants in the siege,
which were copied from the Paris
Archives de la Marine. The manuscript
of Chevalier Johnstone, a
Scotch Jacobite serving with the
French, gives an account of the siege, which is
described elsewhere (<i>post</i>, in chapter viii.) and
has been used by Parkman. The <i>Documents Collected
in France&mdash;Massachussetts Archives</i> (vol.
ix. p. i.) contains one of the narratives.</p>

<p>Of individual experiences and accounts there
are, on the English side, John Montresor’s journal,

letters and orders relating to the siege.
Wright, in his <i>Life of Wolfe</i>, gives various letters
of that active officer. Parkman also uses
a diary of a captain or subaltern in Amherst’s
army, found in the garret of an old house at
Windsor, Nova Scotia. Some contemporary

and other views of that day respecting
the event can be gleaned from

are those in Warburton’s <i>Conquest of
Canada</i> (N. Y., 1850, vol. ii. p. 74),
Brown’s <i>History of Cape Breton</i>, and
the story as recently told with unusual
spirit and acquaintance with the
sources in Parkman’s <i>Montcalm and
Wolfe</i> (vol. ii. chap. xix).</p>

<p>Amherst had wished to push up to
Quebec immediately upon the fall of
Louisbourg, but the news from Abercrombie
and some hesitancy of Boscawen
put an end to the hope. <i>Chatham

<p>The reports of the capture reached
London August 18. (<i>Grenville Correspondence</i>,

<p>Jenkinson writes (Sept. 7, 1758),
“Yesterday the colours that were taken
at Louisbourg were carried in procession
to Saint Paul’s; the mob was immense.”

<p>Speaking of Amherst’s success at Louisbourg,
Burrows, in his <i>Life of Lord Hawke</i> (London,
1883, p. 340), says: “So entirely has the importance
of this place receded into the background
that it requires an effort to understand why the
success of Boscawen and Amherst should have
been thought worthy of the solemn thanks of
Parliament, and why the captured colors of the
enemy should have been paraded through the
streets of London.”</p>

<p>Mr. William S. Appleton, in the <i>Proc. Mass.
Hist. Soc</i>., vol. xi. pp. 297, 298, describes three
medals struck to commemorate the siege of
1758. Cf. also <i>Trans. Quebec Lit. and Hist. Soc.</i>,
1872-73, p. 79.</p>

<p><i>A view of Louisburg in North America, taken
from near the light-house, when that city was besieged
in 1758</i>, is the title of a contemporary copperplate
engraving published by Jefferys. (Carter-Brown,
iii. p. 335.) Cf. the view in Cassell’s
<i>United States</i>, i. 528.</p>

<p class="p2">The plan of the siege, here presented, is reproduced
from Brown’s <i>Hist. of Cape Breton</i>
(p. 297):&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Key</span>: The French batteries to oppose the
landing were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="px1 p1">C. One swivel.<br />
D. Two swivels.<br />
E. Two six-pounders.<br />
F. One twenty-pounder and two six-pounders.<br />
G. One seven-inch and one eight-inch mortar.<br />
H. Two swivels.<br />
I. Two six-pounders.<br />
K. Two six-pounders.<br />
N. Two twelve-pounders.<br />
O. Two six-pounders.<br />
P. Two twenty-four pounders.<br />
Q. Two six-pounders.<br />
R. Two twelve-pounders.</p>

<p class="p2">The points of attack were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="px1">A. Landing of the first column.<br />
B. Landing of the second column.</p>

<p>These troops carried the adjacent batteries and
pursued their defenders towards the city. The
headquarters of the English were now established
at H Q, while the position of the various
regiments is marked by the figures corresponding
to their numbers. Three redoubts (R 1, 2,
3) were thrown up in advance, and two block-houses
(B H 1, 2) were built on their left flank;
and later, to assist communication with Wolfe,
who had been sent to the east side of the harbor,
a third block-house (B H 3) was constructed.
Then a fourth redoubt was raised at Green Hill
(G H R 4) to cover work in the trenches.
Meanwhile the English batteries at the light-house
had destroyed the island battery, and the
French had sunk ships in the channel to impede
the entrance of the English fleet. The first parallel
was opened at T, T1, T2, and a rampart
was raised, E P, to protect the men passing to
the trenches. Wolfe now erected a new redoubt
at R 5, to drive off a French frigate near the
Barachois, which annoyed the trenches; and another
at R 6, which soon successfully sustained
a strong attack. The second (T 3, 4) and third
(T 5, 6) parallels were next established. A boat
attack from the English fleet outside led to the
destruction and capture of the two remaining
French ships in the harbor, opening the way for
the entrance of the English fleet. At this juncture
the town surrendered.</p>

<p>Cf. also the plans in Jefferys’ <i>Natural and
Civil Hist. of the French Dominions in North
America</i> (1760), and in Mante’s <i>Hist. of the
War</i> (annexed). Parkman, in his <i>Montcalm and
Wolfe</i>, ii. 52, gives an eclectic map. <i>Father
Abraham’s Almanac</i>, published at Philadelphia
and Boston in 1759, has a map of the siege.</p>

<p class="pc1"><span class="smcap">By the Editor.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> cartography of Acadia begins with that
coast, “discovered by the English,” which is
made a part of Asia in the map of La Cosa in
1500.<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> The land is buried beneath the waves,

Sinus,” as a part of Asia, in the Ruysch
map of 1508.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> It is a vague coast in the map
of the Sylvanus Ptolemy of 1511.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> For a long
time the eastern coast of Newfoundland and
neighboring shores stood for about all that the
early map-makers ventured to portray; called at
one time Baccalaos, now Corterealis, again Terra
Nova; sometimes completed to an insular form,
occasionally made to face a bit of coast that
might pass for Acadia, often doubtless embracing
in its insularity an indefinite extent that
might well include island and main together,
vaguely expressed, until in the end the region
became angularly crooked as a part of a continental
coast line. The maps which will show
all this variety have been given in previous volumes.
The Homem map of 1558<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> is the earliest
to give the Bay of Fundy with any definiteness.
There was not so much improvement as
might be expected for some years to come, when
the map-makers followed in the main the types
of Ruscelli and Ortelius, as will be seen by
sketches and fac-similes in earlier volumes.</p>

<p>In 1592 the Molineaux globe of the Middle
Temple<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> became a little more definite, but the
old type was still mainly followed. In 1609 Lescarbot
gave special treatment to the Acadian
region<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> for the first time, and his drafts were
not so helpful as they ought to have been to the
more general maps of Hondius, Michael Mercator,
and Oliva, all of 1613, but Champlain in
1612<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> and 1613<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> did better. The Dutch and
English maps which followed began to develop
the coasts of Acadia, like those of Jacobsz
(1621),<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> Sir William Alexander (1624),<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> Captain

1626, and the one in Speed’s <i>Prospect</i>, of the
same year.<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> The Dutch De Laet began to establish
features that lingered long<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> with the
Dutch, as shown in the maps of Jannson and
Visscher; while Champlain, in his great map of
1632,<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> fashioned a type that the French made
as much of as they had opportunity, as, for instance,
Du Val in 1677. Dudley in 1646<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> gave
an eclectic survey of the coast. After this the
maps which pass under the names of Covens
and Mortier,<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> and that of Visscher with the
Dutch, and the Sanson epochal map of 1656<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>
among the French, marked some, but not much,
progress. The map of Heylin’s <i>Cosmographie</i>
in 1663, the missionary map of the same year,<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a>
and the new drafts of Sanson in 1669 show
some variations, while that of Sanson is followed
in Blome (1670). The map in Ogilby,<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> though

<p>To complete the two centuries from La Cosa,
we may indicate among the French maps a missionary
map of 1680,<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> that of Hennepin,<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> the

one given by Leclercq in the <i>Établissement de la
Foy</i> (1691). The latest Dutch development was
seen in the great Atlas of Blaeu in 1685.<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a></p>

<p>With the opening of the eighteenth century,
we have by Herman Moll, a leading English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
geographer of his day, a <i>New Map of Newfoundland,
New Scotland, the isles of Breton, Anticoste,
St. Johns, together with the fishing bancks</i>, which
appeared in Oldmixon’s <i>British Empire in America</i>,
in 1708,<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> and by Lahontan’s cartographer the
<i>Carte générale de Canada</i>, which appeared in the
La Haye edition (1709) of his travels, repeated
in his <i>Mémoires</i> (1741, vol. iii.). A section showing
the southern bounds as understood by the
French to run on the parallel of 43° 30′, is annexed.</p>

<p>From 1714 to 1722 we have the maps of Guillaume
Delisle, which embody the French view
of the bounds of Acadia.</p>

<p>In 1718 the Lords of Trade in England recognized
the rights of the original settlers of the debatable
region under the Duke of York,&mdash;which
during the last twenty years had more than once
changed hands,&mdash;and these claimants then petitioned
to be set up as a province, to be called
“Georgia.”<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

<p>In 1720, Père Anbury wrote a <i>Mémoire</i>, which
confines Acadia to the Nova Scotia peninsula,
and makes the region from Casco Bay to Beaubassin
a part of Canada.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a></p>

<p>In March, 1723, M. Bohé reviewed the historical
evidences from 1504 down, but only allowed
the southern coast of the peninsula to pass under
the name of Acadia.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a></p>

<p>In 1731 the crown took the opinion of the law-officers
as to the right of the English king to the
lands of Pemaquid, between the Kennebec and
the St. Croix, because of the conquest of the
territory by the French, and reconquest causing
the vacating of chartered rights; and this document,
which is long and reviews the history of
the region, is in Chalmers’ <i>Opinions of Eminent
Lawyers</i>, i. p. 78, etc.</p>

<p>In 1732 appeared the great map of Henry
Popple, <i>Map of the British Empire in America
and the French and Spanish settlements adjacent
thereto</i>. It was reproduced at Amsterdam about
1737. Popple’s large MS. draft, which is preserved
in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> is dated 1727.
When in 1755 some points of Popple told against
their claim, the English commissioners were
very ready to call the map inaccurate. We have
the Acadian region on a small scale in Keith’s
<i>Virginia</i>, in 1738. The Delisle map of North
America in 1740 is reproduced in Mills’ <i>Boundaries
of Ontario</i> (1873). The <i>English Pilot</i> of
1742, published at London, gives various charts
of the coast, particularly no. 5, “Newfoundland
to Maryland,” and no. 13, “Cape Breton to New
York.”</p>

<p>Much better drafts were made when Nicolas
Bellin was employed to draw the maps for Charlevoix’s
<i>Nouvelle France</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> which was published
in 1744. These were the <i>Carte de la partie orientale
de la Nouvelle France ou du Canada</i> (vol.
i. 438), a <i>Carte de l’Accadie dressée sur les manuscrits
du dépost des cartes et plans de la marine</i>
(vol. i. 12),<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> and a <i>Carte de l’Isle Royale</i> (vol. ii.
p. 385), beside lesser maps of La Heve, Milford
harbor, and Port Dauphin. These are reproduced
in Dr. Shea’s English version of Charlevoix.
Bellin’s drafts were again used as the basis
of the map of Acadia and Port Royal (nos. 26,
27) in <i>Le petit atlas maritime</i>, vol. i., <i>Amérique
Septentrionale, par le S. Bellin</i> (1764).</p>

<p>The leading English and French general maps
showing Acadia at this time are that of America
in Bowen’s <i>Complete System of Geography</i>
(1747)<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> and D’Anville’s <i>Amérique Septentrionale</i>
(Paris), which was reëngraved, with changes, at

London) 1755, in Douglass’s <i>Summary of the
British Settlements in North America</i>. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>

<p>The varying territorial claims of the French
and English were illustrated in a <i>Geographical
History of Nova Scotia</i>, published at London in
1749; a French version of which, as <i>Histoire
géographique de la Nouvelle Écosse</i>, made by
Étienne de Lafargue, and issued anonymously,
was published at Paris in 1755, but its authorship
was acknowledged when it was later included
in Lafargue’s <i>Œuvres</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> The <i>Mémoire</i>
which Galissonière wrote in December, 1750,
claimed for France westward to the Kennebec,
and thence he bounded New France on the
water-shed of the St. Lawrence and Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>
In 1750-51 Joseph Bernard Chabert was sent by
the French king to rectify the charts of the
coasts of Acadia, and his <i>Voyage fait par ordre
du Roi en 1750 et 1751 dans l’Amérique Septentrionale
pour rectifier les cartes des côtes de l’Acadie,
de l’îsle Royale, et de l’îsle de Terre Neuve</i>,
Paris, 1753, has maps of Acadia and of the coast
of Cape Breton.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p>

<p>In 1753 the futile sessions of the commissioners
of England and France began at Paris. Their
aim was to define by agreement the bounds of
Acadia as ceded to England by the treaty of
Utrecht (1713),<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> under the indefinite designation
of its “ancient limits.” What were these ancient
limits? On this question the French had constantly
shifted their grounds. The commission
of De Monts in 1603 made Acadia stretch from
Central New Brunswick to Southern Pennsylvania,
or between the 40th and 46th degrees of latitude;
but, as Parkman says, neither side cared
to produce the document. When the French
held without dispute the adjacent continent, they
never hesitated to confine Acadia to the peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a>
Equally, as interest prompted, they
could extend it to the Kennebec, or limit it to
the southern half of the peninsula. Cf. the <i>Mémoire
sur les limites de l’Acadie</i> (joint à la lettre
de Begon, Nov. 9, 1713), in the Parkman MSS.
in Mass. Hist. Soc., <i>New France</i>, i. p. 9.</p>

<p>In July, 1749, La Galissonière, in writing to his
own ministry, had declared that Acadia embraced
the entire peninsula; but, as the English
knew nothing of this admission, he could later
maintain that it was confined to the southern
shore only. Cf. again <i>Fixation des limites de
l’Acadie, etc.</i>, 1753, among the Parkman MSS. in
Mass. Hist. Soc., <i>New France</i>, i. pp. 203-269.</p>

<p>On this question of the “ancient limits,” the
English commissioners had of course their way
of answering, and the New England claims were
well sustained in the arguing of the case by Governor
Shirley, of Massachusetts,<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> who with William
Mildmay was an accredited agent of the
English monarch. The views of the opposing
representatives were irreconcilable,<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> and in 1755
the French court appealed to the world by presenting
the two sides of the case, as shown in
the counter memoirs of the commissioners, in a
printed work, which was sent to all the foreign
courts. It appeared in two editions, quarto
(1755) and duodecimo (1756), in three and six
volumes respectively, and was entitled <i>Mémoires
des Commissaires du Roi et de ceux de sa Majesté
Britannique</i>. Both editions have a preliminary
note saying that the final reply of the English
commissioners was not ready for the press, and
so was not included.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> This omission gave occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
to the English, when, the same year (1755),
they published at London their <i>Memorials of the
English and French commissaries concerning the
limits of Nova Scotia or Acadia</i>, to claim that,
by including this final response of the English
commissioners, their record of the conference
was more complete. This London quarto volume<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>
contained various documents.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1757 a fourth volume was added to the
quarto Paris edition, containing the final reply
of the English commissioners, and completing
the record of the two years’ conference. The
four volumes are a very valuable repository of
historical material; and, from printing at length
the documents offered in evidence, it is a much
more useful gathering than the single English
volume, which we have already described. The
points of difference between the two works are
these:&mdash;</p>

<p>The memorial of Shirley and Mildmay (Jan.
11, 1751), given in French only in the Paris edition,
and accompanied by observations of the
French commissioners in foot-notes, is here
given in French and English, but without the
foot-notes. The English memorial of Jan. 23,
1753, lacks the observations of the French commissioners
which accompany it in their vol. iv.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p>Among the “pièces justificatives” in the London
edition, various papers are omitted which
are given in the Paris edition. The reason of
the omission is that they already existed in print.
Such are the texts of various treaties, and extracts
from printed books.</p>

<p>The London edition prints, however, the MS.
sources among these proofs, but does not give
the observations of the French commissioners
which accompany them in the Paris edition.
Among the papers thus omitted in the London
edition are the provincial charter of Massachusetts
Bay and Gen. John Hill’s manifesto, printed
at Boston from Charlevoix.</p>

<p>Vol. iv. of the Paris edition has various additional
“pièces produites par les commissaires
du Roi,” including extracts from Hakluyt, Peter
Martyr, Ramusio, Gomara, Fabian, Wytfliet, as
well as the English charters of Carolina (1662-63,
1665) and of Georgia (1732).</p>

<p>The Paris edition was also reprinted at Copenhagen,
with a somewhat different arrangement,
under the title <i>Mémoires des commissaires
de sa Majesté très chrétienne et de ceux de sa Majesté
Britannique. À Coppenhague, 1755.</i></p>

<p>All three of the editions in French have a
map, marking off the limits of Acadia under different
grants, and defining the claims of France.
It is engraved on different scales, however, in
the two Paris editions, and shows a larger extent
of the continent westerly in the Copenhagen edition.
The fourth volume of the quarto Paris
edition has also a map, in which the bounds respectively
of the charters of 1620, 1662, 1665,
and 1732 (Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia),
claimed by the English to run through to the
Pacific, are drawn.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Jefferys, the English cartographer,
published at London in 1754 his <i>Conduct of the
French with regard to Nova Scotia from its first
settlement to the present time. In which are exposed
the falsehood and absurdity of their arguments
made use of to elude the force of the treaty

<p>The map of the French claims and another
of the English claims are copied herewith from
Jefferys’ reproduction of the former and from
his engraving of the latter, both made to accompany
his later <i>Remarks on the French Memorials
concerning the limits of Acadia, printed at
the Royal Printing-House at Paris, and distributed
by the French ministers at all the foreign courts of
Europe, with two maps exhibiting the limits: one
according to the system of the French, the other

<p>Both of these Jefferys maps were included by
that geographer in his <i>General Topography of
North America and the West Indies</i>, London,
1768, and one of them will also be found in
the <i>Atlas Amériquain</i>, 1778, entitled “Nouvelle
Écosse ou partie orientale du Canada, traduitte
de l’Anglais de la Carte de Jefferys publiée à
Londres en May, 1755. A Paris par Le Rouge.”
Jefferys also included in the London edition of
the <i>Memorials</i> (1755) a <i>New map of Nova Scotia
and Cape Britain, with the adjacent parts of New
England and Canada</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> which is also found in his

showing Acadia, is reproduced herewith.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

the extreme French claim, carrying the boundary
line along the height of land from the Connecticut
to Norridgewock, thence down the Kennebec
to the sea. The secret instructions to Vaudreuil
this same year (1755) allow that the French claim
may be moved easterly from the Sagadahock to
the St. Georges, and even to the Penobscot, if
the English show a conciliatory disposition, but
direct him not to waver if the water-shed is
called in question at the north.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a></p>

to Corlear, as they termed the English governor, while they refused to receive
French missionaries. In negotiations which Bellomont was conducting
(1698) with the Canadian governor, he tried ineffectually to induce a
recognition of the Five Nations as subjects of the English king.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> Meanwhile,
the French were omitting no opportunity to force conferences with
these Indians, and Longueil was trying to brighten the chain of amity with
them as far west as Detroit, where in July, 1701, La Motte Cadillac began
a French post. Within a month the French ratified at Montreal (August
4, 1701) a treaty with the Iroquois just in time to secure their neutrality in
the war which England declared against France and Spain the next year
(1702). So when the outbreak came it was the New England frontiers
which suffered (1703-4),<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> for the Canadians were careful not to stir the
blood of the Iroquois. The French jealously regarded the English glances
at Niagara, and proposed (1706) to anticipate their rivals by occupying it.
When, in 1709, it was determined to retaliate for the ravages of the New
England borders, the Iroquois, at a conference in Albany<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> (1709), were
found ready to aid in the expedition which Francis Nicholson tried to organize,
but which proved abortive. Already Spotswood, of Virginia, was
urging the home government to push settlers across the Alleghanies into
the valley of the Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> But attention was rather drawn to the petty successes
in Acadia,<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> and the spirit of conquest seethed again, when Sir Hovenden
Walker appeared at Boston,<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> and a naval expedition in the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
of 1711 was well under way to capture the great valley of the St. Lawrence.
Stupidity and the elements sent the fleet of the
English admiral reeling back to Boston, leaving
Quebec and Canada once more safe. The
next year (1712) the distant Foxes tried to wrest
Detroit from the French; but its garrison was
too enduring. France had maintained herself
all along her Canadian lines, and she was in
fair hopes of gaining the active sympathy of
the Iroquois, when the treaty of Utrecht (1713)
brought the war to a close.</p>

<p>The language of this treaty declared that
the “Five Nations<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> were subject to the dominion
of England.” The interpretation of
this clause was the occasion of diplomatic fence
at once. The French claimed a distinction
between the subjectivity of the Indians and
domination over their lands. The English insisted
that the allegiance of the Five Nations
carried not only their own hereditary territory,
but also the regions of Iroquois conquests,
namely, all west of the Ottawa River and the
Alleghany Mountains to the Mississippi River.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>
The peace of Utrecht was but the prelude to
a struggle for occupying the Ohio Valley, on
the part of both French and English. Spotswood
had opened a road over the Blue Ridge
from Virginia in 1716, and he continued to
urge the Board of Trade to establish a post
on Lake Erie. Governor Keith, of Pennsylvania,
reported to the board (1718) upon the advances
of the French across the Ohio Valley,
and the English moved effectually when, in 1721, they began to plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
colonists on the Oswego River. By 1726 they had completed their fort
on the lake, and Montreal found its Indian trade with the west intercepted.
Meanwhile, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Virginia
strengthened their alliance with
the Iroquois by a conference at
Albany in September, 1722, and
in 1726 the Indians confirmed the
cession of their lands west and
north of Lake Erie.</p>

<p>When Vaudreuil, in 1725, not
long before his death (April 10)
suggested to the ministry in Paris
that Niagara should be fortified,
since, with the Iroquois backing
the English, he did not find himself
in a position openly to attack
them, the minister replied
that the governor could at least
craze the Indians by dosing them
with brandy. Shortly afterwards
the commission of his successor,
Beauharnois, impressed on that
governor the necessity of always
having in view the forcible expulsion
of the Oswego garrison.
In 1727 the French governor tried
the effect of a summons of the
English post, with an expressed intention “to proceed against it, as may
seem good to him,” in case of refusal; but it was mere gasconade, and
the minister at home cautioned the governor to let things remain as they
were.</p>

by order of Amherst in 1762, and reproduced
in 1776. (Cf. <i>American Atlas</i>, 1776.) The
original drawings are noted in the <i>Catal. of the

<p>A few years later a sort of flank movement was made on Oswego, as
well as on New England, by the French pushing up Lake Champlain, and
establishing themselves in the neighborhood of Crown Point (1731), where
they shortly after built Fort St. Frederick. The movement alarmed New
England more than it did New York.</p>

<p>The French persisted in seeking conferences with the Six Nations,&mdash;as
they had been called since the Tuscaroras joined them about 1713,&mdash;and
in 1734 succeeded in obtaining a meeting with the Onondagas. They
ventured in 1737 to ask the Senecas to let them establish a post at Irondequot,
farther west on Lake Ontario than Oswego. The Iroquois would
not permit, however, either side to possess that harbor. For some years
Oswego was the burden of the French despatches, and the English seemed
to take every possible occasion for new conferences with the fickle Indians.</p>

<p>The most important of these treaties was made at Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
in 1744, when an indefinite extent of territory beyond the mountains
was ceded to the English in the form of a confirmation of earlier
implied grants. A fresh war followed. The New Englanders took Louisbourg,<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a>
but New York seemed supine, and let French marauding parties
from Crown Point fall upon and destroy the fort at Saratoga without being
aroused.<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> Oswego was in danger, but still the New York assembly preferred
to quarrel with the governor; and tardily at best it undertook to
restore the post at Saratoga, while the Albanians were suspected of trading
clandestinely through the Caughnawagas with the French in Canada.
Both sides continued in their efforts to propitiate the Iroquois, while a
parade of arming was made for an intended advance on Crown Point and
Montreal. Governor Shirley, from Boston, had urged it, since a demonstration
which had been intended by way of the St. Lawrence had to be given
up, because the promised fleet did not arrive from England. To keep the
land levies in spirits, Shirley had written to Albany that he would send
them to join in an expedition by the Lakes, and had even despatched a
13-inch mortar by water to New York.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> Before the time came, however,
the rumors of D’Anville’s fleet frightened the New Englanders, and they
thought they had need of their troops at home.<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> It was some time before
Governor Clinton knew of this at Albany, and preparations went on.
Efforts to enlist the Iroquois in the enterprise halted, for the inaction of
the past year had had its effect upon them, and it needed all the influence
of William Johnson, who now first appears as Indian commissioner, to induce
them to send a sufficient delegation to a conference at Albany.</p>

<p>The business still further dragged; the withdrawal of New England became in
the end known, and by September 16 Clinton had determined to abandon
the project, and the French governor had good occasion to twit old Hendrick,
the Mohawk chief, when he ventured with more purpose than prudence

<p>Early the next summer (June, 1747) the French had some experience of
a foray upon their own borders, when a party of English and Indians raided
upon the island of Montreal,&mdash;a little burst of activity conspicuous amid
the paralysis that the quarrels of Clinton and De Lancey had engendered.
Shirley had formed the plan of a winter attack upon Crown Point, intending
to send forces up the Connecticut, and from Oswego towards Frontenac,
by way of distracting the enemy’s councils; but the New York
assembly refused to respond.</p>

<p>The next year (1748) the French, acting through Father Picquet, made
renewed efforts to enlist Iroquois converts, while Galissonière was urging
the home government to send over colonists to occupy the Ohio Valley.
A number of Virginians, on the other hand, formed themselves into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
Ohio Company, and began to send explorers into the disputed valley. In
order to anticipate the English, the French governor had already despatched
Céloron de Bienville to take formal possession by burying lead
plates, with inscriptions, at the mouths of the streams.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a></p>

<p>For the present, there was truce. The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, entered
upon in May, and signed in October (1748), had given each side time to
manœuvre for an advantage. Picquet established a new barrier against
the English at La Presentation, where Ogdensburg now is;<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> and in 1749
Fort Rouillé was built at the present Toronto.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a></p>

<p>The Virginians, meanwhile, began to push their traders farther and farther
beyond the mountains. The Pennsylvanians also sent thither a
shrewd barterer and wily agent in George Croghan, and the French emissaries
whom he encountered found themselves outwitted.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> The Ohio Company
kept out Christopher Gist on his explorations. Thus it was that the
poor Ohio Indians were distracted. The ominous plates of Céloron meant
to them the loss of their territory; and they appealed to the Iroquois, who in
turn looked to the government of New York. That province, however, was
apathetic, while Picquet and Jean Cœur, another Romish priest, who believed
in rousing the Indian blood, urged the tribes to maraud across the
disputed territory and to attack the Catawbas. William Johnson, on the
one side, and Joncaire, on the other, were busy with their conferences,
each trying to checkmate the other (1750); while the English legislative
assemblies haggled about the money it cost and the expense of the forts.
The Iroquois did not fail to observe this; nor did it escape them that
the French were building vessels on Ontario and strengthening the Niagara
fort (1751).</p>

<p>While Charles Townshend was urging the English home government
(1752) to seize the Ohio region forcibly, the French were attacking the
English traders and overcoming the allied Indians, on the Miamis. Virginia,
by a treaty with the Indians at Logstown, June 13, 1752, got permission
to erect a fort at the forks of the Ohio; but the undertaking was
delayed.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1753 Duquesne, the governor of Canada, sent an expedition<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a>
to possess by occupation the Ohio Valley, and the party approached
it by a new route.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> They landed at Presquisle, built a log fort,<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>
carried their munitions across to the present French Creek, and built
there another defence
called Fort Le Bœuf.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a>
This put them during high
water in easy communication
by boat with the Alleghany
River. French tact
conciliated the Indians, and
where that failed arrogance
was sufficient, and the expedition would have pushed on to found new forts,
but sickness weakened the men, and Marin, the commander now dying,
saw it was all he could do to hold the two forts, while he sent the rest of his
force back to Montreal to recuperate. Late in the autumn Legardeur de
Saint-Pierre arrived at Le Bœuf, as the successor of Marin. He had not
been long there, when on the 11th of December a messenger from Governor
Dinwiddie, of Virginia, with a small escort, presented himself at the
fort. The guide of the party was Christopher Gist; the messenger was
George Washington, then adjutant-general of the Virginia militia.<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> Their
business was to inform the French commander that he was building forts
on English territory, and that he would do well to depart peaceably.
Washington had been made conscious of the aggressive character of the
French occupation, as he passed through the Indian town of Venango, at
the confluence of French Creek and the Alleghany River, for he there had
seen the French flag floating over the house of an English trader, Fraser,
which the French had seized for an outpost of Le Bœuf, and there he had
found Joncaire in command.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> Washington had been received by Joncaire
hospitably, and over his wine the Frenchman had disclosed the unmistakable
purpose of his government. At Le Bœuf Washington tarried three
days, during which Saint-Pierre framed his reply, which was in effect that
he must hold his post, while Dinwiddie’s letter was sent to the French
commander at Quebec. It was the middle of January, 1754, when Washington
reached Williamsburg on his return, and made his report to Dinwiddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>The result was that Dinwiddie drafted two hundred men from the Virginia
militia, and despatched them under Washington to build a fort at
the forks of the Ohio. The Virginia assembly, forgetting for the moment
its quarrel with the governor, voted £10,000 to be expended, but
only under the direction of a committee of its own. Dinwiddie found difficulty
in getting the other colonies to assist, and the Quaker element in
Pennsylvania prevented that colony from being the immediate helper, which
it might from its position have become.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some backwoodsmen had been pushed over the mountains
and had set to work on a fort at the forks. A much larger French force
under Contrecœur soon summoned them,<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> and the English retired. The
French immediately began the erection of
Fort Duquesne.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-493a.jpg" width="200" height="44" id="i493a"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>While this was doing, Dinwiddie was toiling
with tardy assemblies and their agents
to organize a regiment to support the backwoodsmen. Joshua Fry was to
be its colonel, with Washington as second in command. The latter, with
a portion of the men, had already pushed forward to Will’s Creek, the present
Cumberland. Later he advanced with 150 men to Great Meadows,
where he learned that the French, who had been reinforced, had sent out
a party from their new fort, marching towards him. Again he got word
from an Indian&mdash;who, from his tributary character towards the Iroquois,
was called Half-King, and who had been Washington’s companion on his
trip to Le Bœuf&mdash;that this chieftain with some followers had tracked two
men to a dark glen, where he believed the French party were lurking.
Washington started with forty men to join Half-King, and under his guidance
they approached the glen and found the French. Shots were exchanged.
The French leader, Jumonville,
was killed, and all but one of his
followers were taken or slain.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-493b.jpg" width="200" height="69" id="i493b"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The mission of Jumonville was to
scour for English, by order of Contrecœur,
now in command of Duquesne, and to bear a summons to any he
could find, warning them to retire from French territory. The precipitancy
of Washington’s attack gave the French the chance to impute to
Washington the crime of assassination; but it seems to have been a pretence
on the part of the French to cover a purpose which Jumonville had
of summoning aid from Duquesne, while his concealment was intended to
shield him till its arrival. Rash or otherwise, this onset of the youthful
Washington began the war.</p>

<p>The English returned to Great Meadows, and while waiting for reinforcements
from Fry, Washington threw up some entrenchments, which
he called Fort Necessity. The men from Fry came without their leader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
who had sickened and died, and Washington, succeeding to the command
of the regiment, found himself at the head of three hundred men, increased
soon by an independent company from South Carolina.</p>

<p>Washington again advanced toward Gist’s settlement, when, fearing an
attack, he sent back for Mackay, whom he had left with a company of
regulars at Fort Necessity. Rumors thickening of an advance of the
French, the English leader again fell back to Great Meadows, resolved
to fight there.  It was now the first of July,
1754. Coulon de Villiers, a brother of Jumonville,
was now advancing from Duquesne.
The attack was made on a rainy day, and for
much of the time a thick mist hung between
the combatants. After dark a parley resulted in Washington’s accepting
terms offered by the French, and the English marched out with the honors
of war.<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The young Virginian now led his weary followers back to Will’s Creek.
It was a dismal march. The Indian allies of the French, who were only
with difficulty prevented from massacring the wounded English, had been
allowed to kill the cattle and horses of the little army; and Washington’s
men had to struggle along under the burdens of their own disabled companions.
Thus they turned their backs upon the great valley, in which
not an English flag now waved.</p>

<p class="p2">Appearances were not grateful to Dinwiddie. His house of burgesses
preferred to fight him on some domestic differences rather than to listen to
his appeals to resist the French. He got little sympathy from the other colonies.
The Quakers and Germans of Pennsylvania cared little for boundaries.
New York and Maryland seemed slothful.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> Only Shirley, far away
in Massachusetts, was alive, but he was busy at home.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> The Lords of
Trade in London looked to William Johnson to appease and attach the
Indians; but lest he could not accomplish everything, they directed a congress
of the colonial representatives to be assembled at Albany, which
talked, but to the liking neither of their constituents nor of the government
in England.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a></p>

<p>Dinwiddie, despairing of any organized onset, appealed to the home government.
The French king was diligently watching for the English ministry’s
response. So when Major-General Braddock and his two regiments
sailed from England for Virginia, and the Baron Dieskau and an army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
with the Marquis of Vaudreuil<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> to succeed Duquesne as governor, sailed
for Quebec, the diplomates of the two crowns bowed across the Channel,
and protested to each other it all meant nothing.</p>

<p>The English thought that with their superiority on the sea they could
intercept the French armament, and Admiral Boscawen was sent to hover
about the Gulf of St. Lawrence. He got only three ships of them,&mdash;the
rest eluding him.</p>

<p>The two armies were to enter the great valleys, one of the St. Lawrence,
the other of the Ohio, but not in direct opposition. Dieskau was hurled
back at Lake George; Braddock on the Monongahela. We must follow
their fortunes.</p>

<p>In February, 1755, Braddock landed at Hampton, Virginia, and presently
he and Dinwiddie were living “in great harmony.” A son of Shirley of
Massachusetts was serving Braddock as secretary, and he was telling a correspondent
how “disqualified his general was for the service he was employed
in, in almost every respect.” This was after the young man had
seen his father, for Braddock had gone up to Alexandria<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> in April, and had
there summoned for a conference all the governors of the colonies, Shirley
among the rest, the most active of them all, ambitious of military renown,
and full of plans to drive the French from the continent. The council
readily agreed to the main points of an aggressive campaign. Braddock
was to reduce Fort Duquesne; Shirley was to capture Niagara. An army
of provincials under William Johnson was to seize Crown Point. These
three movements we are now to consider; a fourth, an attack by New
Englanders upon the Acadian peninsula, and the only one which succeeded,
is chronicled in another chapter.<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<p>Braddock’s first mistake was in moving by the Potomac, instead of across
Pennsylvania, where a settled country would have helped him; but this
error is said to have been due to the Quaker merchant John Hanbury.
He cajoled the Duke of Newcastle into ordering this way, because Hanbury,
as a proprietor in the Ohio Company, would profit by the trade which
the Virginia route would bring to that corporation. Dinwiddie’s desire to
develop the Virginia route to the Ohio had doubtless quite as much to do
with the choice. While plagued with impeded supplies and the want of
conveyance as he proceeded, Braddock chafed at the Pennsylvanian indifference
which looked on, and helped him not. He wished New England was
nearer. The way Pennsylvania finally aided the doomed general was
through Benjamin Franklin, whom she had borrowed of New England. He
urged the Pennsylvania farmers to supply wagons, and they did, and Braddock
began his march. On the 10th of May he was at Will’s Creek,<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
2,200 men, and as his aids he had about him Captains Robert Orme and
Roger Morris, and Colonel George Washington. Braddock invested the
camp with an atmosphere little seductive to Indian allies. There were fifty
of them present at one time, but they dwindled to eight in the end.<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> Braddock’s
disregard had also driven off a notorious ranger, Captain Jack, who
would have been serviceable if he had been wanted.</p>

<p>On the 10th of June the march was resumed,&mdash;a long, thin line, struggling
with every kind of difficulty in the way, and making perhaps three
or four miles a day. By Washington’s advice, Braddock took his lighter
troops and pushed ahead, leaving Colonel Dunbar to follow more deliberately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
On the 7th of July this advance body was at Turtle Creek, about
eight miles from Fort Duquesne.</p>

<p class="pf300">A “Plan of Fort le Quesne, built by the
French at the fork of the Ohio and Monongahela
in 1754,” was published by Jefferys, and is
included in his <i>General Topography of North
America and the West Indies</i>, London, 1768. I
suppose this to be based upon the MS. plan
noted in the <i>Catal. of the King’s Maps</i> (Brit.
Mus.), ii. 184. Cf. the plan (1754) in the <i>Memoirs</i>
of Robert Stobo, Pittsburgh, 1854, which is
repeated in Sargent’s <i>Braddock’s Exped.</i>, p. 182,
who refers to a plan published in London in
1755, mentioned in the <i>Gentleman’s Mag.</i>, xxv.
P. 383. Stobo’s plan is also engraved in <i>Penna.
Archives</i>, ii. 147, and the letters of Stobo and
Croghan respecting it are in <i>Penna. Col. Rec.</i>,
vi. 141, 161. Parkman refers (i. 208) to a plan
in the Public Record Office, London, and (p.
207) describes the fort as does Sargent (p. 182).
See the plan in Bancroft, orig. ed., iv. 189, and
Gay’s <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 260.</p>

<p class="pf300">Duquesne was finished in May, 1755. Cf. Duquesne’s
Memoir on the Ohio and its dependencies,
addressed to Vaudreuil, dated Quebec, July
6, 1755, and given in English in <i>Penna. Archives</i>,
2d ser., vi. 253. M’Kinney’s Description of Fort
Duquesne (1756) is in Hazard’s <i>Penna. Reg.</i>, viii.
318; and letters of Robert Stobo, who was a
hostage there after the surrender of Fort Necessity,
are in <i>Col. Rec. of Penna.</i>, vi. 141, 161. Cf.
notice of Stobo by L. C. Draper in <i>Olden Time</i>,
i. 369. Parkman also refers to a letter of Captain
Hazlet in <i>Olden Time</i>, i. 184.</p>

<p class="pf300">Sargent says (p. 184) that in 1854 the magazine
was unearthed, which at that time was all remaining
visible of the old fort. (Hazard’s <i>Penna.

the magazine in John Frost’s <i>Book of the Colonies,

<p>The enemy occupying the fort consisted of a few companies of French
regulars, a force of Canadians, and about 800 Indians,&mdash;all under Contrecœur,
with Beaujeu, Dumas, and Ligneres as lieutenants. They knew from
scouts that Braddock was approaching, and Beaujeu was sent out with over
600 Indians and 300 French, to ambush the adventurous Briton.</p>

<p>As Braddock reached the ford, which was to put him on the land-side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
the fort, Colonel Thomas Gage, some years later known in the opening
scenes of the American Revolution,<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> crossed in advance, without the opposition
that was anticipated. Beaujeu had intended to contest the passage,
but his Indians, being refractory, delayed him in his march.</p>

<p>Gage, with the advance, was pushing on, when his engineer, laying out
the road ahead, saw a man, apparently an officer, wave his cap to his followers,
who were unseen in the woods. From every vantage ground of
knoll and bole, and on three sides of the column, the concealed muskets
were levelled upon the English, who returned the fire. Beaujeu soon fell.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>
Dumas, who succeeded in command, thought the steady front of the redcoats
was going to carry the day, when he saw his Canadians fly, followed
by the Indians, after Gage had wheeled his cannon upon the woods. A
little time, however, changed all. The Indians rallied and poured their
bullets into the massed, and very soon confused, British troops.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>Braddock, when he spurred up, found everybody demoralized except the
Virginians, who were firing from the tree-trunks, as the enemy did. The
British general was shocked at such an unmilitary habit, and ordered them
back into line. No one under such orders could find cover, and every puff
from a concealed Indian was followed by a soldier’s fall. No exertion of
Braddock, or of Washington, or of anybody, prevailed.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
The general had four horses shot under him; Washington had two. Still the hillsides and
the depths of the wood were spotted with puffs of smoke, and the slaughter-pen
was in a turmoil. Young Shirley fell, with a bullet in his brain.<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a>
Horatio Gates and Thomas Gage were both wounded. Scarce one Englishman
in three escaped the bullets. The general had given the sign to retreat,
and was wildly endeavoring to restore order, when a ball struck him
from his horse. The flight of the survivors became precipitous, and when
the last who succeeded in fording the river stopped to breathe on the other
side, there were thirty Indians and twenty Frenchmen almost upon them.
The French, however, pursued no farther. They had enough to do to gather
their plunder, while the Indians unchecked their murderous instincts as
they searched for the wounded and dying Britons. The next morning a
large number of the Indians left Contrecœur for their distant homes, laden
with their booty. The French general feared for a while that Braddock,
reinforced by Dunbar, would return to the attack. He little knew the condition
of his enemy. The British army had become bewildered fugitives.
Scarce a guard could be kept for the wounded general, as he was borne
along on a horse or in a litter. When they met Dunbar the fright increased.
Wagons and munitions were destroyed, for no good reason, and
the mass surged eastward. The sinking Braddock at last died, and they
buried him in the road, that the tramp of the men might obliterate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
grave.<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> Nobody stopped till they reached Fort Cumberland, which was
speedily turned into a disordered hospital. The campaign ended with
gloomy forebodings. Dunbar, the surviving regular colonel, instead of staying
at Cumberland and guarding the frontier, retreated to Philadelphia,
leaving the Virginians to hold Cumberland and its hospitals as best they
could.</p>

<p class="p2">By the death of Braddock Shirley became the ranking officer on the continent,
and we must turn to see how the tidings of his new responsibilities
found him.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts governor was at Albany when the bad news reached
him, and Johnson being taken into the secret, the two leaders tried to keep
it from the army. Shirley immediately pushed on the force destined for
Fort Niagara, at the other end of Lake Ontario; while Johnson as speedily
turned the faces of his men towards Lake George. Shirley’s army found
the path to Oswego, much of the way through swamp and forest; and the
young provincials sorrowfully begrimed their regulation bedizenments,
assumed under the king’s orders, as with the Jersey Blues they struggled
along the trail and tugged through the watercourses. It was easier to
get the men to their destination than to transport the supplies, and many
stores that were on the way were abandoned at the portages when the
wagoners heard the fearful details from the Monongahela. Short rations
and discouragements harried the men sorely. The axe and spade
were put in requisition, and additional forts were planned and constructed
as the army pursued its way. Across the lake at Fort Frontenac
the enemy held a force ready to be sent against Oswego if Shirley
went on, for the capture of Braddock’s papers had revealed all the English
plans. Shirley put on a brave face, with all his bereavement, for
the death of his son, with Braddock, was a heavy blow. A council of
war, on the 18th of September, determined him to take to the lake with
his bateaux as soon as provisions arrived. He had now got word of Dieskau’s
defeat,<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> and he tried to use it to inspirit the braves at his camp. It
seemed to another council, on the 27th, that the attempt to trust their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
river bateaux on the lake was foolhardy, and so the purpose of the campaign
was abandoned. At the end of October he left the garrison to
strengthen the forts, and returned to Albany. He did not get much comfort
there. Johnson showed no signs of following up the victory of Lake
George, and as late as November Shirley was still at Albany, where he
had received his new commission, advising a movement on Crown Point
for the winter;<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> and in December he was exciting the indignant jealousy
of Johnson<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> by daring to instruct him about his Indian management, for
Johnson had now been made Indian superintendent.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> Shirley had despatched
these orders from New York, where he was laying before a congress
of governors his schemes for a new campaign.</p>

<p class="p2">We need now to see how Dieskau’s defeat had been the result of the
third of the expeditions of the campaign just brought to a close.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>Before the arrival of Braddock, Shirley had begun (January, 1755) arrangements
for an attack on Crown Point,&mdash;a project confirmed, as we
have seen, by the council at Alexandria,
where William Johnson, whom
Shirley had already named, was approved
as the commander. Johnson,
as a young Irishman of no military
experience, had been sent over twenty
years before by his uncle, Sir Peter Warren, the admiral, to look after
some lands of his in the Mohawk Valley. Settling here and building a
house, about ten years earlier than this, he had called it first Mount Johnson,
though when it was fortified, at a later day, it was usually called Fort
Johnson.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> It was the seat of numerous conferences with the Indians, over
whom Johnson gained an ascendency, which he constantly turned to the
advantage of the English.</p>

<p>The provincials who assembled, first at Albany and then at the carrying
place between the Hudson and Lake George, were mostly New Englanders,
and a Connecticut man, General Phineas Lyman, was placed second in
command. The French were not without intelligence of their enemy’s
purpose, derived, as already said, from the captured papers of Braddock.
So Dieskau, who had come over, as we have seen, with reinforcements,
was ordered to Lake Champlain instead of Oswego, as had been the original
intention.</p>

<p>Johnson found among those who joined his camp some who knew much
better what war was than he did: such were Colonel Moses Titcomb and
Lieutenant-Colonel Seth Pomeroy, of Massachusetts; and Colonel Ephraim
Williams, who had just made his will, by which the school was founded
which became Williams College. He also was a Massachusetts man, as
was Israel Putnam by birth, though now a Connecticut private. The later
famous John Stark was a lieutenant of the New Hampshire forces. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
were also others in command who knew scarce more of war than Johnson
himself, and such was Colonel Timothy Ruggles, of a Massachusetts regiment,
who was a college-bred lawyer and an innkeeper, destined to be president
of the Stamp Act congress.</p>

<p>At the carrying place Lyman began a fort, which was named after him,
but all preparations for the campaign proceeded very leisurely, the fault
rather of the loosely banded union and hesitating purpose that existed
among the colonies which had undertaken the movement; and matters
were not mended by a certain incompatibility of temper existing between
Johnson and Shirley, now commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Leaving a garrison at Fort Lyman, the main body marched to the lake,
to which Johnson had, out of compliment to the king, given the name of
George. Meanwhile Dieskau had pushed up in his canoes to the very head
of Lake Champlain, and had started through the wilderness to attack
Fort Lyman. An Indian brought the news to Johnson, and Ephraim Williams
and Hendrick, the Mohawk chief, were sent out to intercept the
enemy. Dieskau, gaining information by capturing a messenger bound to
Fort Lyman, and finding his Indians indisposed to assail a fort armed
with cannon, turned towards the lake. Scouts informed him of the approach
of the party under Williams, and an ambush was quickly planned.
The English scout was badly managed, and fell into the trap. The commander
and Hendrick were both killed. Nathan Whiting, of Connecticut,
extricated the force skilfully, and a reinforcement from Johnson rendered
it possible to hold the French somewhat in check. Could Dieskau have
controlled his savages, however, he might have followed close enough to
enter the English camp with the fugitives. As he did not, Johnson was
given time to form a defence of his wagons and bateaux, mixed with tree-trunks,
and when the French came on the English fought vigorously behind
their barricade. Johnson was wounded and was borne to his tent.
Lyman brought the day to a successful issue, and at its end his men
leaped over the breastworks and converted the defeat of the French into a
rout.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a part of Dieskau’s Canadians and Indians had broken away
from him, and had returned to the field where Williams had been killed, in
order to strip the slain. There, near a pond, known still as Bloody Pond,<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>
a scouting party from Fort Lyman attacked them and put them to flight.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a></p>

<p>The French, routed by Lyman, were not followed far, and in gathering
the wounded on the field Dieskau was discovered. He was borne to Johnson’s
tent, and the English commander found it no easy task to protect
him from the vengeance of the Mohawks. He was, however, in the end
taken to New York, whence he sailed for England, and eventually reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
France, but so shattered from his wounds that he died, though not till several
years afterwards.</p>

<p>The defeat of the French had taken place on the 8th of September, and
an active general would have despatched a force to intercept the fugitives
before they reached their canoes, at the head of Lake Champlain; but
timidity, the fear of a fresh onset, or a dread of a further tension of the
weakening power of the army induced Johnson to tarry where he was, and
to erect a fort, which in compliment to the royal family he named Fort
William Henry, while in a similar spirit he changed the name of the post
at the carrying place from Fort Lyman to Fort Edward. Of Lyman he
seems to have been jealous, and in writing his report on the fight he
makes no mention of the man to whose leadership the success was largely
due. In this way Lyman’s name failed to obtain recognition in England,
while the commander received a gift of £5,000 from Parliament and became
Sir William Johnson, Baronet.</p>

<p>If Lyman’s advice had been followed, Ticonderoga might have been
seized; but the French who reached it had so strongly entrenched themselves
in a fortnight that attack was out of the question, and though Shirley,
writing from Oswego, urged an advance, nothing was done. A council
of war finally declared it inexpedient to proceed, and on the 27th of November
Johnson marched the main part of his army southerly to their
winter quarters.</p>

<p>British and French diplomates finally ceased bowing to each other, while
their ships and armies fought together, and in May and June (1756), respectively,
the two governments declared a war which was now nearly two
years old.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> The French at once sent the Marquis de Montcalm, now about
forty-four years of age, to succeed Dieskau. With
him went the Chevalier de Lévis and the Chevalier
de Bourlamaque as the second and third
in command, and Bougainville as his principal
aide-de-camp. By the middle of May the French general was in Quebec,
and soon proceeded to Montreal to meet Vaudreuil, who was not at all
pleased to share the responsibility of the coming campaign with another.
The French troops were now divided, being mainly placed at Carillon (Ticonderoga),
Fort Frontenac, and Niagara, and these posts had been during
the winter severally strengthened,&mdash;Lotbinière<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> superintending at Ticonderoga,
Pouchot at Niagara, and two French engineers at Frontenac.</p>

<p>Already in February the French, by sending a scouting party, had captured
and destroyed Fort Bull, a station of supplies at the carrying place
on the way from Albany to Oswego; but the intervening time till June
was spent in preparation. Word now coming of an English advance on
Ticonderoga, Montcalm proceeded thither, and found the fort of Carillon,
as the French termed it, which was now completed, much as he would
wish it.</p>

<p>Shirley, on his part, was preparing to carry out such of the lordly plans
which he had suggested at New York as proved practicable. He would
repeat the Niagara movement himself, with a hope of better success. For
the command in the campaign on Lake Champlain he named Gen. John

Grant’s book as “a charming book, though far
from being historically trustworthy;” while it
affords a “genuine picture of colonial life.”
Grahame (<i>United States</i>, ii. 256) considers the
picture of manners “entirely fanciful and erroneous.”</p>

<p class="pf400">Mrs. Grant herself says “I certainly have
no intention to relate anything that is not true;”
yet it must be remembered that she wrote in
1808, forty years after she, a girl of thirteen, had
left the country. The book was published at
Edinburgh in 1808; again in 1809, also in New
York and in Boston the same year; in London
in 1817, and again in New York in 1836 and
1846. The last edition is one printed at Albany
in 1876, with notes by Joel Munsell and a memoir
by Gen. J. G. Wilson. Cf. Munsell’s <i>Bibliog.
of Albany</i>; Lossing’s <i>Schuyler</i> (1872), i.
34; Tuckerman’s <i>America and her Commentators</i>,
p. 171.</p>

<p class="pf400">The most extensive repository of historical
data respecting Albany is in Joel Munsell’s <i>Annals
of Albany</i> (1850-59), 10 vols. Vol. i. to iv.
were issued in a second edition, 1869-71. (See
Vol. IV. p. 435.)</p>

<p>Johnson, who
had now got his commission as sole Indian superintendent, was busily
engaged in conferences with the Six Nations, whom he secured somewhat
against their will to the side of the English. He extended his persuasions
even to the Delawares and Shawanoes. Some of these tribes were coquetting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
however, with Vaudreuil at Montreal, and it was too apparent
that nothing but an English success would confirm any Indian alliance.</p>

<p>Shirley also carried out a plan of his own in organizing a body of New
England whalemen and boatmen for the transportation service, who, being
armed, could dispense with an escort. These were placed under the command
of Lieut.-Col. John Bradstreet. In May, before Montcalm’s arrival,
a party had been sent by Vaudreuil to cut off the communications of
Oswego, and Bradstreet encountered and beat them.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs in June, 1756, when Abercrombie and Webb
arrived with reinforcements, and Pitt was writing
in England, “I dread to hear from America.”<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>
Shirley went to New York and received them as
well as Loudon, who followed the others on the
23d of July. The new governor proceeded to
Albany, and countermanded the orders for the Niagara expedition, and
stirred up the New Englanders by promulgating a royal direction which
in effect made a provincial major-general subordinate to a regular major.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a></p>

<p>Affairs were stagnating in the confusion consequent upon the change
of command, and Albany was telling other towns what it was to have foreign
officers billeted upon its people. Not till August did some fresh
troops set off for Oswego, when apprehension began to be felt for the safety
of that post. It was too late. The reinforcement had only reached the
carrying place when they heard of the capture of the forts.</p>

<p>Montcalm had suddenly returned from Ticonderoga to Montreal, and
had hastened to Niaouré Bay (Sackett’s Harbor), where Villiers was with
the force which had escaped Bradstreet’s attack. Here Montcalm gathered
about three thousand men, and then appeared without warning before
the entrenchments at Oswego. Fort Ontario was soon abandoned by
its defenders, and gave Montcalm a place to plant his cannon against the
other fort, while he sent a strong force by a ford for an attack on the other
bank. Colonel Mercer, the commander, was soon killed by a cannon-shot
from Ontario. The enemy’s approach in the rear discouraged the garrison,
and they surrendered. Montcalm did what he could to prevent a slaughter
of the prisoners, which was threatened when his Indian allies became infuriated
by the rum among the plunder.<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a></p>

<p>While the French were destroying what they could not remove, and
were later retiring to Montreal, Webb, who commanded the relief which
never came, fell back to German Flats, and orders were sent to Fort William
Henry to suspend preparations for a movement down the lake.<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a></p>

<p>Montcalm was soon back at Carillon, watching Winslow’s force at Fort
William Henry, while the rest of Loudon’s army was divided between Fort
Edward and Albany. Neither opponent moved, and, leaving garrisons
at their respective advanced posts, they retired to winter quarters. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>

<p>The French had the advantage in Indian allies; and during the autumn
and winter the forays of the prowling savage and the adventurous scout
over the territory neighboring to Lake George and Lake Champlain were
checked by the English as best they could. Foremost among their partisans
was the New Hampshire ranger, Robert Rogers, whose exploits and
those of the Connecticut captain, Israel Putnam, fill a large space in the
records of this savage warfare.</p>

<p>The campaign of the next year (1757) opened in March with an attempt
to surprise Fort William Henry. The French under Rigaud came up on
the ice, 1,600 strong, by night. The surprise failed. They burned, however,
two sloops and some bateaux. The next day they summoned Major
Eyre, the English commander, but he felt that his four hundred men were
enough to hold the fort, and declined to surrender. Rigaud now made a
feint of storming the work, but it was only to approach the storehouses,
saw-mill, and other buildings outside the entrenchments, which he succeeded
in firing, and then withdrew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>Montcalm, when he heard the details, was not over-pleased; and if he
had had his way, De Lévis or Bougainville would have led the attack.
As it was, Rigaud was a brother of the governor, and Vaudreuil was
tenacious of his superiority. The news broke in upon a round of festivities
at Montreal, stayed only by Lent. At this season Montcalm prayed,
as he had before feasted, with no full recognition of the feelings which
Vaudreuil entertained for him. But the minister in France knew it, and
he was not, perhaps, so ready to doubt the numbers of the English, exaggerated
in Vaudreuil’s report, as he was the prowess of the Canadians
in comparison with the timidity of Montcalm and his regulars, which was
also reported to him. In Montreal, however, the mutual distrust and dislike
of the governor and the general were cloaked with a politeness that
was not always successful, when they were apart, in keeping their feelings
from their neighbors.</p>

<p>The English general had left the line of the approach by the lakes from
Canada to be watched by Webb, who was at Fort Edward, while Col.
Munro, with a small force, held Fort William Henry, at the head of Lake
George. This was the most advanced post of the English, and the opportunity
for Montcalm had come.</p>

commingled forces, and they rallied at Fort St. John on the Sorel. On
again they swept in a fleet of bateaux and canoes to Ticonderoga. They

<p>At the portage, and before launching his flotilla on Lake George, Montcalm
held a grand council, and bound his Indian allies by a mighty belt of
wampum. Up the smaller lake the main body now went by boat, but some
Iroquois allies led De Lévis, with 2,500 men, along its westerly bank. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
force on the lake disembarked under cover of a point of land, which hid
them from the English.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">THE SITE OF FORT WILLIAM HENRY, 1851.</p>
         <p class="pf400">From a sketch made in 1851. The fort was
on the bluff at the left, now the position of the
Fort William Henry hotel. Montcalm’s trenches
were where the modern village of Caldwell is
built, seen beyond the water. The way to the
entrenched camp started along the gravelly beach
in the foreground, towards the spectator.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The extent of the demonstration was first made known to Munro when
the savages spread out across the lake in their bark canoes. Montcalm
soon pushed forward La Corne and De Lévis till they cut the communications
of the English with Fort Edward, and then the French general
began his approaches from his own encampment. When he advanced his
lines to within gun-shot of the ramparts, he summoned the fort. Munro
declined to surrender, hoping for relief from Webb; but the timid commander
at Fort Edward only despatched a note of advice to make terms.
This letter was intercepted by Montcalm, who sent it into the fort, and it
induced Munro to agree to a capitulation.</p>

<p>On the 9th of August the English retired to the entrenched camp, and
the French entered the fort. Munro’s men were to be escorted to Fort
Edward, being allowed their private effects, and were not to serve against
the French for eighteen months. Montcalm took the precaution to explain
the terms to his Indian allies, and received their seeming assent;
but the savages got at the English rum, and, with passions roused, they
fell the next day upon the prisoners. Despite all exertions of Montcalm
and the more honorable of his officers, many were massacred or carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
off, so that the line of march became a disorderly rout, beyond all control
of the escort, and lost itself in the woods. Not more than six hundred
in a body reached Fort Edward, but many others later straggled in.
Another portion, which Montcalm rescued from the clutch of the Indians,
was subsequently sent in under a strong escort.</p>

<p>Loudon reached New York on the last of August,<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> but he had already
heard of the Lake George disaster from a despatch-boat which met him
on the way. On landing he learned from Albany that Montcalm had retired.
Webb, who was much perplexed with the hordes of militia which
all too late began to pour in upon him, was now bold enough to think there
was no use of retreating to the passes of the Hudson. The necessity of
allowing the Canadians to gather their crops, as well as Montcalm’s inability
to transport his cannon, had influenced that general to retreat. At
Montreal he learned the stories of the fiendish cruelty practised upon their
prisoners by the Indians who had preceded him, and who had not been
restrained by Vaudreuil,&mdash;so Bougainville said; for the governor’s policy
of buying some of the captives with brandy led to the infuriation which
wreaked itself on the rest.</p>

<p>The campaign closed in November with an attack on the post at German
Flats, a settlement of Palatine Germans, by a scouting body of French
and Indians under one of Vaudreuil’s Canadians, Belêtre. Everything disappeared
in the havoc, which a detachment sent by Colonel Townshend
from Fort Herkimer, not far off, was powerless to check. Before Lord
Howe, with a larger force from Schenectady,<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> could reach the scene, the
French had departed.</p>

<p class="p2">The winter of 1757-58 at Montreal and Quebec passed with the usual
official gayety and bureaucratic peculation. The passions of war were only
aroused as occasional stories of rapine and scalps came in from the borders.
Good hearty rejoicing took place, however, in March, over the report that
a scouting party from Ticonderoga had encountered Rogers, and that the
dreaded partisan had been killed and his followers annihilated. The last
part of the story was too true, but Rogers had escaped, leaving behind his
coat, which he had thrown off in the fray, and in its pocket was his commission,
the capture of which had given rise to the belief in his death.
Meanwhile, on the English side a new spirit of control was preparing to
give unaccustomed vigor to the coming campaign. In England’s darkest
hour William Pitt had come to power, thrown up by circumstances. He
was trusted in the country’s desperation, and proved himself capable of imparting
a momentum that all British movements had lacked since the war
began. He developed his plans for America, and made his soldiers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
sailors spring to their work. Loudon was recalled. The provincial officer
was made the equal of the regular, by conferring upon him the same right
of seniority by commission. The whole colonial service felt that they were
thereby made equal sharers of the honors as well as of the burdens of the
times. Pitt put his finger upon the three vulnerable gaps in the French
panoply. He would reach Quebec by taking Louisbourg; and singling
out a stubborn colonel who had shown his mettle in Germany, he made him
Major-General Amherst, and sent him with a fleet to take Louisbourg, as
we may see in another chapter.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> Circumstances, or a mischance in judgment,
made him retain Abercrombie for the Crown Point campaign, but a
better decision named Brigadier John Forbes to attack Fort Duquesne. It
belongs to this place to tell the story of these last two campaigns.</p>

<p>In June, Abercrombie had assembled at the head of Lake George a force
of 15,000 men, of whom 6,000 were regulars. Montcalm was at Ticonderoga
with scarce a quarter as many; but Vaudreuil was tardily sending forward
some scant reinforcements under De Lévis. The French general got
tidings early in July of the embarkation in England, but had done nothing
up to that time to protect his army, which was lying on the peninsula of
Ticonderoga, mainly outside the fort. In fact, he was at a loss what to
do; no help had reached him, and the approaching army was too numerous
to hope for success. He thought of retreating to Crown Point, but some
of his principal officers opposed it. He now began a breastwork of logs
on the high ground before the fort, and, felling the trees within musket

<p>All the while, the English were in a heydey of assurance. Pitt was waiting
anxiously in London for the first tidings. Abercrombie, now a man of
fifty-two years, did not altogether inspire confidence. His heavy build and
lethargic temperament made lookers-on call him “aged.” There was, however,
a proud expectation of success from the vigorous, companionable Earl
Howe, the brigadier next in command, whom Pitt hoped to prove the real
commander, because of the trust which Abercrombie put in him. On the
5th of July the immense flotilla, which bore the English army and its train,
started down Lake George. To a spectator it completely deadened the
glare of the water for miles away. The next morning at daybreak the army
was passing Rogers’ Slide, whence a French party under Langy watched
them. By noon it had disembarked at the extreme north end of Lake
George, and near the river conducting to Ticonderoga they built an entrenchment,
to protect their bateaux. Rogers, with his rangers, was sent
into the woods to lead the way, while the army followed; but the denseness
of the forest soon brought the column into confusion. Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
the French party under Langy, finding the English had got between them
and their main body, endeavored to pass around the head of the English
column, and, in doing
so, got equally confused
in the thickness of the
wood, and suddenly encountered
that part of
the English force where
Lord Howe and Major
Putnam were. A skirmish
ensued, Howe
fell,<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> and the army was
practically without a
head. Rogers, who
was in advance, turned
back upon Langy, and
few of the Frenchmen
escaped.</p>

<p>In the morning Abercrombie
withdrew the
army to the landing.
Bradstreet, with his watermen,
having rebuilt
the bridges destroyed
by the French, the original
intention of skirting
the river on the west was abandoned, and the army now started to
follow the ordinary portage across the loop of the river, which held the
rapids. The French had already deserted their positions at either end
of this portage. At the northerly end, near a saw-mill, the English general
halted his army. He was at one base-corner of the triangular peninsula
of which Ticonderoga was the apex. He had now to encounter,
not far from the fort, the entrenchment which Montcalm was busily constructing
out of the forest-trees which had been laid along its front as by
a hurricane. Scorning all measures which might have spared his army
great losses, and thoughtless of movements which could have intercepted
Montcalm’s reinforcements,<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> the English general undertook, from the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
mill, to direct repeated assaults in front. His soldiers made a deadly
push through the entanglements of the levelled trees and against the barricade,
behind which the defenders were almost wholly protected. He
could have done nothing to help Montcalm so much. The stores of the
French were sufficient for eight days only, and the chief dread of the
French general was that Abercrombie would cut his communications with
Crown Point.</p>

<p>As it was, De Lévis, with a considerable force, arrived in

across the river from the sides of Mount Defiance; but accomplished
nothing, and took no further part in the day’s work. About noon the attack
began in front, and all day long&mdash;now here, now there&mdash;the French repelled
assaults which showed prodigies of valor and brought no reward.
Some rafts, with cannon sent by Abercrombie to enfilade the French line,
were driven back by the guns of the fort. At twilight the cruel work
ceased. Abercrombie had lost nearly 2,000 men, and Montcalm short of
400.</p>

<p>Montcalm was still anxious. He knew that Abercrombie had cannon,
and had not used them. The most natural thing in the world for the English
general would be to occupy the night in bringing the cannon up. In
the morning Montcalm sent out to reconnoitre, and it was found that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
English, still 13,000 strong, had reëmbarked, and all the signs showed the
great precipitancy of their flight.</p>

<p>The French general could well rejoice, but he exaggerated his enemy’s
strength to 25,000 and their losses to 5,000, which last was considerably
more than the victor’s whole force.</p>

<p>Abercrombie apparently magnified beyond belief an enemy whom he had
not seen, and went up the lake in trepidation, lest he should be pursued.
Safe on his old camping-ground at the head of the lake, he made haste
to entrench himself, while Montcalm, lucky to escape as he did, prepared
for a new campaign by rebuilding his lines. So the two armies still
watched each other at a safe distance.<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a></p>

<p>Montcalm for a while tried to harass the English communications with
Fort Edward, by sending out his leading partisan, Marin; but Rogers was
more than his match, and gave the English general some grains of comfort
by his successes. Putnam, however, was captured and carried to Canada.
Meanwhile, much greater relief came to the army’s spirits in September
when the news of Bradstreet’s success at Fort Frontenac reached
them.</p>

<div class="floatright">

<p>A council of war had forced Abercrombie to give Bradstreet 3,000 men,
and with these he made his way to Oswego, whence, towards the end of
August, his whale-boats and bateaux pushed out upon the lake, and in
three days he was before Frontenac. The fort quickly surrendered. Bradstreet
levelled it, ruined seven armed vessels, put as much of the plunder
as he could carry on two others, and returned to Oswego unmolested.
Here he landed his booty, destroyed the vessels, and the French naval
power on Ontario was at an end. He began his march for Albany, and,
passing the great carrying place where Brigadier Stanwix was building a
fort for the protection of the valley, left
there a thousand men for its garrison.
In October Amherst came overland from
Boston, with some of his victorious regiments
from Louisbourg. It was too late
for further campaigning; and each side
left garrisons at their camps, and retired to winter quarters.</p>

<p>The destruction of Frontenac and the French fleet on Ontario had cut
off Fort Duquesne from its sources of supply, and to the substantial, if not
brilliant, success of Brigadier John Forbes<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> we must now turn. It is a
story of a stubborn Scotch purpose. Forbes had no dash, and purposely
dallied with the forming and marching of his army to weary the Indian
allies of the French, and to secure time to gain over all of the savages
that he could. The English general got upon his route by June, but soon
fell sick, and was carried through the marches in a litter; but he breasted
every discomfort and harassing complexity of the details, which he had to
manage almost in every particular, with a courage that might have done
credit to a man in vigor. He had made up his mind to open a new road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
over the mountains more direct than Braddock’s. Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry Bouquet, a Swiss officer of the Royal Americans, sustained him in
this purpose; but Washington argued for the older route,&mdash;not without
inciting some distrust, for Forbes was not blind to the rival interests of
Pennsylvania and Virginia, and suspected that Washington was influenced
by a greater loyalty for his colony than for the common cause.</p>

<p>Forbes did not fail, however, to recognize the young Virginian’s merit
in the kind of warfare which was before them; and there exists in Washington’s
hand a plan of a line of march for forces in a forest, with diagrams
for throwing the line into order of battle, which Forbes had requested
him to make.<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> Braddock’s defeat was not lost on Forbes, and in
his marches and preparations he availed himself of all the arts of woodcraft
and partisanship which Washington could teach him. He did not, nevertheless,
have a very high opinion of the provincials in his train, and, with
the exception of some of their higher officers, they were, no doubt, a sorry
set. As he pushed on he established fortified posts for supplies; but all
the help he ought to have got from his quartermaster-general, Sir John
Sinclair, stood him in poor stead, for that officer was “a very odd man,”
and only added to his general’s perplexities. The advice of Washington
about taking the other route had so far unsettled Forbes’s faith in him,
that, though he told his subordinates among the advance to consult with
the Virginia colonel, it might not be best, he suggested, to follow his advice.
While the march went on he had little success in attaching some Cherokees
and Catawbas, for they stayed no longer than the gifts held out. An
occasional scout brought him intelligence of the enemy, and he felt that
their numbers were not great, and that the weariness of delays would
drive the Indian allies of the French into desertion,&mdash;as it did.</p>

<p>At Raystown he built Fort Bedford, to protect his supplies, and pushed
on to Loyalhannon<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> Creek, and there founded his last depot, fifty miles
away from Duquesne.</p>

<p>In August Forbes was planning for a general convention with the Indians
at Easton. The treaty of the previous year had secured the Delawares
and Shawanoes, and a further conference had been held with them
in April.<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> Sir William Johnson was bullied, as Forbes says, into bringing
into the compact the eastern tribes of the Six Nations, while other influences
induced the Senecas and the western tribes also to join, despite
the labors of Joncaire to retain them in the French interests. The chief
difficulty was to inspire the Ohio Indians with a distrust of the French;
while the failure of French presents, thanks to British cruisers on the
ocean, was beginning to dispose them for a change. A Moravian brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
Christian Frederick Post, was sent to the tribes on a hazardous mission,
and his confidence and fearlessness carried him through it alive; for he had
to confront French officers at the conferences, one of which was held close
by Fort Duquesne. As a result of his mission, the convention of the allied
tribes which met the English at Easton in October decided confidently
to send a wampum belt, in the name of both the whites and the red men,
to the Ohio Indians, and Post, with an escort, was commissioned to bear
it, the party setting out from Loyalhannon. It became a struggle for
persuasion between the English messenger and a French officer, who again
confronted Post and offered the Indians a belt of wampum of his own.
The French won the young warriors; but Post impressed the sages of
the Indian councils, and the old men carried the day. The overtures of
peace from the English were accepted, and this happened notwithstanding
that the garrison of Duquesne had but just badly used a reconnoitring
party of the English under Major Grant, of the Scotch Highlanders.</p>

<p>It was a success of forest diplomacy that encouraged and rendered despondent
the respective sides. The French scouting parties were hanging
about Loyalhannon, while the little army at Duquesne kept dwindling
under the prospect of famine, now that Bradstreet’s raid on Frontenac
had checked their supplies. A rough and weltering October made the
bringing up of provisions very difficult for the English, and their weakening
general found his time, on his litter, disagreeably spent, as he says,
“between business and medicine;” but in early November he himself
reached Loyalhannon. He would have stopped here for winter quarters,
but scouts brought in word that the French were defenceless; so a force
was hurriedly pushed forward in light order, which, when it reached
Turkey Creek, heard a heavy boom to the west. It was the explosion of
the French mines, as the garrison of Duquesne blew up the fort and
fled.</p>

<p>Forbes hutted a portion of his troops within a stockade, which he called
Pittsburg, and early in December began his march
eastward. The debilitated general reached Philadelphia,
but died in March. Few campaigns were ever
conducted so successfully from a litter of pain.</p>

<p>The winter of 1758-59 was an unquiet one in Canada. Vaudreuil and
Montcalm disputed over the
results of the last campaign,
and the governor was doing
all he could to make the home
government believe that Montcalm
neither deserved, nor could profit by, success. All his intrigue to
induce the general’s recall only resulted in the ministry sending him

<p>There was never more need of strong counsel in Canada. The gasconade
of Vaudreuil had reached the limit of its purpose. The plunder
by officials, both of the people and of the king, was an enormity that could
not last much longer. It seemed to the wisest that food and reinforcements,
and those in no small amounts, could alone save Canada, unless,
indeed, some kind of a peace could be settled upon in Europe. To claim
help and to learn, Bougainville and Doreil were sent to France. Nothing
they said could gain much but what was easily given,&mdash;promotion in rank
to Montcalm and the rest. They represented that the single purpose
which now animated the English colonies was quite a different thing from
the old dissensions among them, the existence of which had favored the
French in the past. The demand in Europe was, however, inexorable; and
all that France could promise was a few hundred men and a campaign’s supplies
of munitions.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1759 Bougainville came back with the
little which was precious to those who had nothing, as Montcalm said.
But the returning soldier brought word of the great fleet which England
was fitting out to attack Quebec, and that fifty thousand men would constitute
the army with which Canada was to be invaded. Vaudreuil could
hardly count twenty thousand men to meet it, and to do this he had to
reckon the militia, <i>coureurs de bois</i>, and Indians. If the worst came, Montcalm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
thought he could concentrate what force he had, and retreat by way

<p>On the English side matters looked encouraging. Amherst, a sure and
safe soldier, without any dash, was made commander-in-chief, and was to
direct in person the advance over the old route from Lake George,<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> while
at the same time he took measures to reëstablish Oswego and reinforce
Duquesne. To the latter point General Stanwix was sent, where in the
course of the summer he laid out and strengthened a new fort, called after
the prime minister. Fort Pitt was not, however, wholly secure till success
had followed Brigadier Prideaux’s expedition to Niagara, the reduction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
which was also a part of Amherst’s plans. Prideaux seated Haldimand at
Oswego, and made good its communications with the Mohawk Valley. It
was an open challenge to the French, and after Prideaux had proceeded to
Niagara, Saint-Lac de la Corne came down with a force from the head of
the St. Lawrence rapids to attack Haldimand, but the English cannon sent
the French scampering to their boats, and the danger was over.</p>

</div></div>

<p>At Niagara, in the angle formed by the lake and the Niagara River,
stood the strong fort which Pouchot had rebuilt. It had a dependency<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>
some distance above the cataract, commanded by Joncaire; but that officer
withdrew from this outwork on the approach of Prideaux, and reinforced
the main work. It was the same Joncaire who had formerly resisted successfully,
but of late less so, the efforts of Johnson to secure the alliance
to the English of the Senecas and the more westerly tribes of the Six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
Nations; and now Johnson with a body of braves was in Prideaux’s camp.
The English general advanced his siege lines, and had begun to make
breaches in the walls of the fort, when new succor for the French approached.
Their partisan leaders at the west had gathered such bushrangers
and Indians as they could from Detroit and the Illinois country,
and were assembling at Presquisle and along the route to the Monongahela
for a raid on the English there, in the hopes of recapturing the post.
They got word from Pouchot of his danger, and immediately marched to
his assistance, under Aubry and Ligneris.</p>

<p>Early in the siege, Prideaux had been killed by the bursting of one of
his own shells, and the command fell on Johnson, who now went with a
part of his force to meet the new-comers, already showing themselves up
the river. He beat them, and captured some of their principal officers,
while those who survived led the panic-stricken remainder to their boats
above the cataract. Thence they fled to Presquisle, which they burned.
Here the garrisons of LeBœuf and Venango joined them, and the fugitives
continued on to Detroit, leaving the Upper Ohio without a fighting Frenchman
to confront the English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>On the same day of the defeat, negotiations for a surrender of Fort
Niagara began, and Pouchot, being convinced of the reverses which his
intending succorers had experienced, finally capitulated. Johnson succeeded
in preventing any revengeful onset of his Indians, who had not forgotten
the massacre of William Henry.</p>

<p>The extreme west of Canada was now cut off from the central region,
which was threatened, as we shall see, by Amherst
and Wolfe, and Vaudreuil could have little hope
of preserving it. To press this centre on another
side, Amherst now sent General Thomas Gage to
succeed Johnson in the command of the Ontario
region, and, gathering such troops as could be
spared from the garrisons, to descend the St. Lawrence
and capture the French post at the head of
the rapids. Gage had little enterprise, and was
not inclined to undertake a movement in which
dash must make up for the lack of men, and he
reported back to Amherst that the movement was
impossible.</p>

<p>When this disappointment came to the commander-in-chief
he was at Crown Point,&mdash;but we
must track his progress from the beginning.</p>

<p>At the end of June, Amherst had at Lake George
about 11,000 men, one half regulars. He set about
the campaign cautiously. He had fortified new
posts in his rear, and began the erection of Fort
George at the head of the lake, of which only one
bastion was ever finished. On the 21st of July he
embarked his army on the lake, and, landing at
the outlet, he followed the route of Abercrombie’s
approach to Ticonderoga during the previous year.
The disparity of the opposing armies was much like
that when Montcalm so successfully defended that
post; but Bourlamaque, who now commanded, had
orders to retire, and was making his arrangements.
Amherst brought up his cannon, and protected his
men behind the outer line of entrenchments, which
Bourlamaque had abandoned. On the night of the
23d, Bourlamaque escaped down the lake, but a
small force under Hebecourt still held the fort,
which kept up a show of resistance till the evening
of the 26th, when the remaining French, leaving
a match in the magazine, also fled. In the night one bastion was hurled
to the sky, and the barracks were set on fire.</p>

describes the previous fort (<i>Travels</i>, London,
1771, ii. 207), and it is delineated in <i>Mémoires
sur les affaires du Canada</i>, p. 53.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Amherst began to repair the works, with his army now succumbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
somewhat to the weather,<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> and was about advancing down the lake, when
scouts brought in word that Bourlamaque had also abandoned Crown Point.
So Amherst again advanced. He knew nothing of the progress Wolfe was
making in his attack on Quebec by water, but he did know that it was
a part of Pitt’s plan that success on Lake
Champlain should inure to Wolfe’s advantage,
and this could only be brought about
by an active pursuit of the enemy down the
lake. Amherst was, however, not a general
of the impetuous kind, and believed beyond
all else in securing his rear. So he began
to build at Crown Point the new fort, whose
massive ruins are still to be seen, and sent
out parties to open communication with the
Upper Hudson on the west and with the
Connecticut River on the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>The French, as he knew, were strongly posted at Isle-aux-Noix, in the
river below the lake, and they had four armed vessels, which would render
dangerous any advance on his part by boat. So Captain Loring, the English
naval commander, was ordered to put an equal armament afloat for an
escort to his flotilla.</p>

<p>Bourlamaque, meanwhile, was confident in his position, for he knew that,
in addition to his own strength, Lévis had been sent up to Montreal with
800 men to succor him, if necessary, and all the militia about Montreal
was alert.</p>

<p>Amherst, on his part, was anxious to know how the campaign was going
with Wolfe. In August he sent a messenger with a letter by the circuitous
route of the Kennebec, which Wolfe received in about a month, but it
helped that general little to know of the building going on at Crown Point.
Amherst then tried to pass messengers through the Abenaki region, but
they were seized. Upon this, Major Rogers was sent with his rangers to
destroy the Indian village of St. Francis, which he did, and then, to elude
parties endeavoring to cut him off, he retreated by Lake Memphremagog
to Charlestown, on the Connecticut, enduring as he went the excruciating
horrors of famine and exhaustion.</p>

<p>It was near the middle of October when Loring pronounced the armed
vessels ready, and Amherst embarked; but the autumn gales soon convinced
him that the risks of the elements were too great to be added to
those of the enemy, and after his demonstration had caused the destruction
of three of the enemy’s vessels, and one had reached their post on the
Richelieu River, the English general, still ignorant of Wolfe’s luck, withdrew
to Crown Point, and gave himself to the completion of its fortress.</p>

<p class="p2">We must now turn to the most brilliant part of the year’s work. This
was the task assigned to General Wolfe, who had already shown his quality
in the attack on Louisbourg the previous year.<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> Late in May he was at
Louisbourg, with his army under three brigadiers, Monckton, Townshend,
and Murray, and the fleet of Saunders, who had come direct from England,
combined with that of Holmes, who had been first at New York to take
troops on board. A third fleet under Durell was cruising in the gulf to
intercept supplies for Quebec, but that officer largely failed in his mission,
for all but three of the French supply ships eluded him, and by the 6th of
June, when the last of Wolfe’s fleet sailed out of Louisbourg, Quebec had
received all the succor that was expected.</p>

<p>The French had done their best to be prepared for the blow. Their
entire force at Quebec was congregated in the town defences and in a
fortified camp, which had been constructed along the St. Lawrence, beginning
at the St. Charles, opposite Quebec, and extending to the Montmorenci,
and on this line about 14,000 men, beside Indians, manned the
entrenchments. A bridge connected the camp with Quebec, and a boom
across the St. Charles at its mouth was intended to stop any approaches
to the bridge by boats; while earthworks along the St. Charles formed a
camp to fall back upon in case the more advanced one was forced. Beside
the 106 cannon mounted on the defences of the city, there were gun-boats
and fire-ships prepared for the moment of need. In the town the Chevalier
de Ramezay commanded a garrison of one or two thousand men. Montcalm
had his headquarters<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> in the rear of the centre of the entrenched
line along the St. Lawrence, and Vaudreuil’s flag was flying nearer the
St. Charles.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June the masts of the advanced ships of the English
were first seen, and one of the fire-ships was ineffectually sent against
them. There was a difficult passage between the north shore of the river
and the lower end of the Island of Orleans; but the English fleet managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
to pass it without loss, much to the disappointment of the French, who
had failed to plant a battery on the side of Cape Tourmente, whence they
could have plunged shot into the passing vessels. Past the dangers of the
stream, the English landed their army on the island,<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> less than 9,000 in
all, for Wolfe could count little on the sailors who were needed for the
management of the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a></p>

<p>He knew also that he must place little reliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
on the cannon of the ships, for the high rocks and bluffs of the defences
were above the elevation which could be given to the guns, and a broad
stretch of mud-flats kept the vessels from a near approach to that portion
of the French camp which was low and lay nearest the St. Charles. Cape
Diamond, the promontory of Quebec, so jutted out that Wolfe could not
inspect at present the banks of the river above the town.</p>

<p>Montcalm had determined on a policy of wearing out his assailants,&mdash;and
he came very near doing it,&mdash;and when a gale sprang up he hoped that
its power of devastation would be his best ally. When he saw that fail,
he tried his fire-ships; but the British sailors grappled them and towed
them aground, where they were harmless.</p>

<p>Wolfe’s next movement was to occupy Point Levi, opposite the city,<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>
whence he showered shot and shell into the town, and drove the non-combatants
out. The French tried to dislodge him, but failed. The
English army was now divided by the river, and ran some risk of attack in
detail. Montcalm, however, was not tempted; nor was he later, when
Wolfe next landed a force below him, beyond the Montmorenci, and began
to entrench himself, though the English general was interrupted in the
beginning of this movement by an attack of Canadians, who had crossed
the Montmorenci by an upper ford. The attack was not persisted in,
however, and Wolfe was soon well entrenched. The cannonading was
incessant. Night after night the sky was streaked with the shells from
the vessels, and from each of Wolfe’s three camps.</p>

<p>The dilatory policy of Montcalm soon began to tell on his force, and
then weariness and ominous news from Bourlamaque and Pouchot hastened
the desertion of his Canadians. Wolfe tried to affect the neighboring
peasantry by proclamations more and more threatening, and felt himself
obliged at last to enforce his authority by the destruction of crops and
villages.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, in the night, the “Sutherland” and some smaller
vessels pushed up the river beyond the town, while a fleet of boats was
dragged overland back of Point Levi and launched above, out of gun-shot
from the town. A force was sent by a détour to operate with them. Thus
Wolfe, in defiance of the French general, had made a fourth division of
his troops, each liable to separate attack. The English vessels above the
town made descents along the north shore, and took some prisoners, but
did little else. The French made their final attempt with a huge fire-raft,
but it was as unsuccessful as the earlier ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<p>Wolfe now determined to provoke Montcalm to fight, and under cover of
a cannonade from Point Levi and from some of his ships<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> he landed a
force from boats beneath the precipice at the lower end of the French
camp. An additional body at the same time crossed by a ford, in front
of the falls of Montmorenci, which was traversable at low tide. The impetuosity
of the grenadiers, who were in advance, not waiting for support,
and a tempest which at the moment broke over them, convinced the quick
eye of Wolfe that the attempt was to fail, and he recalled his men. The
French let them retire in good order, and began to think their Fabian policy
was to be crowned with success. Wolfe was correspondingly shaken
and rebuked the grenadiers. He began to think, even, that the season
might wear away with no better results, and that he should have to abandon
the campaign.</p>

<p>There was one plan yet, which might succeed, and he sought to push
more ships and march more troops above the town. Murray, who now
took command at that point, began to raid upon the shore, but with poor
success. Montcalm sent Bougainville with 1,500 men to patrol the shore,
and incessant marching they had, as the English by water flitted up
and down the river with the tides, threatening to land. The English
restlessness was too oppressive, however, for the French camp at Beaufort,
which felt that its supplies from Three Rivers and Montreal might
be cut off at any moment by an English descent. Desertions increased,
and rapidly increased when in August the French got decisive and unfavorable
news from Lake Champlain and Ontario. The French fearing an
approach of Amherst down the St. Lawrence, Quebec was further weakened
by the despatch of Lévis to confront the English in that direction.
By the end of August there were no signs of immediate danger at Montreal,
and the French took heart.</p>

<p>Wolfe was now ill,&mdash;not so prostrate, however, but he could propose
various new plans to a council of his brigadiers, but his suggestions were
all rejected as too hazardous. They recommended, in the end, an attempt
to gain the heights somewhere above the town, and force Montcalm to
fight for his communications. Wolfe was ready to try it; but it was the
first of September before he was able to undertake it.<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> He saw no other
hope, slight as this one was. The letter which Amherst had sent to him
by the Kennebec route had just reached him, and he felt there was to be
no assistance from that quarter. On the 3d of September he evacuated the
camp at Montmorenci, Montcalm being prevented from molesting him by
a feint which was made by boats in front of his Beaufort lines. Other
troops were now marched above Quebec, and when Wolfe himself joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
Admiral Holmes, who commanded that portion of the fleet which was
above the town, he found he had almost 3,600 men, beside what he might
draw from Point Levi, for his adventurous exploit. The French were deceived,
and thought that the English were to go down the river, as indeed,
if the scheme to scale the banks failed on the first attempt, they were.
Bougainville’s corps of observation was increased, and it was its duty to
patrol a long stretch of the river shore.</p>

<p>Wolfe with a glass had discovered a ravine,<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> up which it seemed possible
for a forlorn hope to mount, and the number of tents at its top did not
indicate that there was a numerous guard there to be overcome. Robert
Stobo, who had been a prisoner in Quebec after the fall of Fort Necessity,
had recently joined the
camp, and his biographer
says that his testimony
confirmed Wolfe in the
choice, or rather directed
him to it.<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> While the
preparations were going
on, the English ships
perplexed Bougainville
by threatening to land
troops some distance up
the river, near his headquarters;
and by floating
up and down with the
tide, the English admiral
kept the French on
the constant march to be
abreast of them.</p>

<p>The plan was now ripe.
Wolfe was to drop down
the river in boats with
the turn of the tide, having
with him his 3,600
men, and 1,200 were to
join him by boat from
Point Levi. As night
came on, Admiral Saunders, who commanded the fleet in the basin below
Quebec, made every disposition as if to attack the Beauport lines, and
Montcalm thought the main force of the British was still before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>As the ships opposite Bougainville began to swing downward with the
tide, the French general took pity on his weary men, and failed to follow
the moving vessels. This kept the main part of his troops well up the river.
This French general had, as it happened, informed the shore guards
and batteries towards the town that he should send down by water a convoy
with provisions, that night, which was to creep along to Montcalm’s
camp under the shadow of the precipice. Wolfe heard of this through
some deserters, and he seized the opportunity to cast off his boats and get
ahead of the convoy, in order that he might answer for it if hailed. He
was hailed, and answered in the necessary deceitful French. This quieted
the suspicion of the sentries as he rowed gently along in the gloom.</p>

<p>As it happened, the Canadian officer, Colonel de Vergor, who commanded
the guard at the top of the ravine, where Wolfe’s advanced party clambered
up, was asleep in his tent, and many of his men had gone home, by his
permission, to hoe their gardens. The English forlorn hope made, therefore,
quick work, when they reached the top, as they rushed on the tents.
Their shots and huzzas told Wolfe, waiting below, that a foothold was
gained, and he led his army up the steeps with as much haste as possible.
While the line of battle was forming,
detachments were sent to attack
the batteries up the river,
which, alarmed by the noise, were
beginning to fire on the last of the
procession of boats. The celerity
of the movement accomplished its
end, and the French were driven
off and the batteries taken.</p>

<p>Sheer good luck, quite as much as skill and courage, had at last placed
Wolfe in an open field, where Montcalm must fight him, if he would save
his communications and prevent the guns of Quebec, in the event of its
capture,<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> being turned upon his camp.</p>

<p>Not a mile from Quebec, and
fronting its walls, Wolfe had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
formed his final line, but he had turned its direction on the left, and there
the line faced the St. Charles. In the early morning he saw the French
form on a ridge in front of him, when some skirmishing ensued, as also in
his rear, where a detachment sent by Bougainville began to harass him.
With a foe before and behind, quick and decisive work was necessary.</p>

<p>Montcalm, whom Admiral Saunders had been deceiving all night, hurried
over to Vaudreuil’s headquarters in the morning to learn what the firing
above the town meant. From this position he saw the seriousness of the
situation at once. The red coats of the British line were in full view
beyond the St. Charles. He hastened across the bridge, and was soon on
the ground, bringing the
regiments into line as
they came up. But all
the help he had a right
to expect did not come.
Ramezay made excuses
for not sending cannon.
Vaudreuil kept back the
left wing at Beaufort, for
fear that Saunders meant
something, after all.</p>

<p>Montcalm’s impetuosity,
now that it was
unshackled, could not
brook delay. It would
take time to concert with
Bougainville an attack
on the front and rear
of the British simultaneously,
and that time
would give Wolfe the
chance to entrench and
bring up reinforcements,
if he had any. So the
decision in Montcalm’s
council was for an instant
onset.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock
when Wolfe saw it coming.
He advanced his line to meet it, and when the French were close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
upon them the fire burst from the English ranks. Another volley followed;
and as the smoke passed away, Wolfe saw the opportunity and gave the
word to charge. As he led the Louisbourg grenadiers he was hit twice
before a shot in the breast bore him to the ground. He was carried to the
rear, and as he was sinking he heard those around him cry that the enemy
was flying. He turned, praised God, and died.<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a></p>

<p>Montcalm, mounted, borne on by the panic, was shot through the breast
just before he entered the town, and was taken within to die.</p>

<p>Part of the fugitives got into Quebec with their wounded general; part
fled down the declivity towards the St. Charles, and, under cover of a stand
which some Canadian bushrangers made in a thicket, succeeded in getting
across the river to the camp, where everything was in the confusion which
so easily befalls an army without a head. It was necessary for the English
to cease from the pursuit, for Townshend,<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> who had come to the command
(Monckton being wounded), feared Bougainville was upon his rear, as
indeed he was. When that general, however, found that the English commander
had recalled his troops, and was forming to receive him, he withdrew,
for he had only 2,000 men,&mdash;probably all he could collect from their
scattered posts,&mdash;and seeing the English were twice as many, he did not
dare attack. So Townshend turned to entrenching, and working briskly
he soon formed a line of protection, and had a battery in position confronting
the horn-work beyond the St. Charles, which commanded the bridge.</p>

<p>Vaudreuil was trying to get some decision, meanwhile, out of a council
of war at Beaufort. They sent to Quebec for Montcalm’s advice, and the
dying man told them to fight, retreat, or surrender. The counsel was
broad enough, and the choice was promptly made. It was retreat. That
night it began. Guns, ammunition, provisions,&mdash;everything was left.
The troops by a circuitous route flocked along like a rabble, and on the
15th they went into camp on the hill of Jacques Cartier, thirty miles up
the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The morning after the fight, the tents still standing along the Beaufort
lines were a mockery; for Ramezay knew that Vaudreuil had gone, since
he had received word from him to surrender the town when his provisions
failed.</p>

<p>Bougainville was still at Cap Rouge, and undertook to send provisions
into Quebec. Lévis had joined Vaudreuil at Jacques Cartier,<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> and inspired
the governor with hope enough to order a return to his old camp. On the
evening of the 18th the returning army had reached St. Augustine, when
they learned that Ramezay had surrendered and the British flag waved
over Quebec.</p>

<p>Preparations for the departure of the fleet were soon made, and munitions
and provisions for the winter were landed for the garrison, which
under Murray was to hold the town during the winter. The middle of
October had passed, when Admiral Saunders, one of his ships bearing the
embalmed body of Wolfe, sailed down the river. Montcalm lay in a grave,
which, before the altar of the Ursulines, had been completed out of a cavity
made by an English shell.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<p>The winter passed with as much comfort as the severe climate and a
shattered town would permit. There were sick and wounded to comfort,
and the sisters of the hospitals devoted themselves to French and English
alike. A certain rugged honesty in Murray won the citizens who remained,
and the hours were beguiled in part by the spirits of the French ladies.
There was an excitement in November, when a fleet of French ships from
up the river tried to run the batteries, and seven or eight of them which
did so carried the first despatches to France which Vaudreuil had succeeded
in transmitting. There was rough work in December, in getting
their winter’s wood from the forest of Sainte-Foy, for they had no horses,
and the merriment of companionship, checkered with the danger of the
skulking enemy, was the only lightening of the severities of the task. Deserters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
occasionally brought in word that Lévis was gathering and exercising
his forces for an attack, so vigilance was incessant. Both sides preserved
the wariness of war in onsets and repulses at the outposts, and the English
usually got the better of their enemies. Captain Hazen and some New
England rangers merited the applause which the regular officers gave them
when they buffeted and outwitted the enemy in a series of skirmishes.</p>

<p>By April it became apparent that Lévis was only waiting for the ice in
the river to break up, when he could get water carriage for his advance.
Murray knew that the enemy could bring much greater numbers against
him, for his 7,000 men of the autumn, by sickness and death, had been reduced
to about 3,000 effectives, and the spies of Lévis kept the French general
well informed of the constant weakening of the English forces.</p>

<p>The French placed their cannon and stores on the frigates and smaller
vessels which had escaped up the river in the autumn, and with their army
in bateaux they started on the 21st April for the descent from Montreal.
With the accessions gained on the way, by picking up the scattered garrisons,
Lévis landed between eight and nine thousand men at Cap Rouge,
and advanced on Sainte-Foy. The English at the outposts fell back, and
the delay on the part of the French was sufficient for Murray to learn of
their approach. He resolved to meet them outside the walls. It must be
an open-field fight for Murray, since the frozen soil still rendered entrenching
impossible in the time which he had. He led out about three thousand
men, and at first posted himself on the ridge, where Montcalm had drawn
up his lines the year before. He pushed forward till he occupied Wolfe’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
ground of the same morning, when, with his great superiority of cannon,
he found a position that gave him additional advantage, which he ought to
have kept. The fire of the English guns, however, induced Lévis to withdraw
his men to the cover of a wood, a movement which Murray took for a
retreat, and, emulous of Wolfe’s success in seizing an opportune moment,
he ordered a general advance. His cannon were soon stuck in some low
ground, and no longer helped him. The fight was fierce and stubborn; but
after a two hours’ struggle, the greater length of the enemy’s line began to
envelop the English, and Murray ordered a retreat. It was rapid, but not
so disordered that Lévis dared long to follow.</p>

<p>The English had lost a third of their force; the French loss was probably
less. Murray got safely again within the walls, and could muster
about 2,400 men for their defence.<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> There was sharp work, and little time
left further to strengthen the walls and gates. Officer and man worked
like cattle. A hundred and fifty cannon were soon belching upon the increasing
trenches of Lévis, who finally dragged some artillery up the defile
where Wolfe had mounted, and was thus enabled to return the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>

<p>Both sides were anxiously waiting expected reinforcements from the
mother country. On the 9th of May a frigate beat up the basin, and to the
red flag which was run up at Cape Diamond she responded with similar
colors. It was ominous to Lévis, for he felt she was the advanced ship of
a British squadron, as she proved to be. It was a week before others arrived,
when some of the heavier vessels passed up the river and destroyed
the French fleet. As soon as the naval result was certain, Lévis deserted
his trenches, left his guns and much else, with his wounded, and hastily fled.
This was in the night; in the morning the French were beyond Murray’s
reach.</p>

<p>Their loss of cannon and munitions was a serious one, and the stores
from France which might have replaced them were already intercepted by
the English cruisers. Vaudreuil and Lévis made their dispositions to defend
Montreal, their last hope; yet it was not a place in itself capable of
successful defence, for its lines were too weak. It soon became evident
that it was to be attacked on three sides; and the French had hopes that
so dangerous a combination of armies, converging without intercommunication,
would enable them to crush the enemy in detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>Amherst was directing the general advance on the English side. He
kept the largest force with him, and passed from Oswego, across Ontario,
and down the St. Lawrence. If Lévis sought to escape westward and hold
out at Detroit, Amherst intended to be sure to intercept him. He had
about 11,000 men, including a body of Indians under Johnson. Near the
head of the rapids he stopped long enough to capture Fort Lévis, now
under Pouchot, and because they could not kill the prisoners, three fourths
of Johnson’s Indians mutinied and went home. Amherst now shot the
rapids with his flotilla, not without some loss, and on September 6th he
reached Lachine, nine miles above Montreal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other commanders had already approached the city so
near as to open communication with each other. Murray had sailed up
the river with about 2,500 men, but was soon reinforced by Lord Rollo
with 1,300 others from Louisbourg. The English had some skirmishes
along the banks, but Bourlamaque, who was opposing them, fell back with a
constantly diminishing force, as the Canadians, despite all threats and blandishments,
deserted him. Murray was ahead of the others, when he stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
just before reaching Montreal, and encamped on an island in the river.
He was not without apprehension that he might have to bear the brunt
of an attack alone.</p>

<p>Bougainville, meanwhile, was trying to resist Haviland’s advance at
the Isle-aux-Noix, for this English general now commanded on the Champlain
route. The two sides were not ill-matched as to numbers; but the
English advance was skilfully conducted, and the French found themselves
obliged to retreat down the river and unite with Bourlamaque. It was
now that Haviland, pushing on, opened communication by his right with
Murray, and both stood on the defensive, waiting to hear of Amherst’s
approach above the town.</p>

<p>Vaudreuil saw there was no time for delays, and at once submitted a
plan of capitulation. A few notes were exchanged to induce less onerous
conditions; but Amherst was not to be moved. On September 8th the
paper was signed, and all Canada passed to the English king; the whole

<p>This stipulation was adhered to, and during the autumn the principal
French officers were on their way to France. The season for good weather
on the ocean was passed, and the transportation was not accomplished
without some wrecks, accompanied by suffering and death. Vaudreuil,
Bigot, Cadet, and others found a dubious welcome in France after they had
weathered the November storms. The government was not disposed that
the loss of Canada should be laid wholly to its account, and the ministry
had heard stories enough of the peculations of its agents in the colony to
give a chance of shifting a large part of the responsibility upon those whose
bureaucratic thefts had sapped the vitals of the colony. Trials ensued,
the records of which yield much to enable us to depict the rotten life of
the time; and though Vaudreuil escaped, the hand of the law fell crushingly
on Bigot and Cadet, and banishment, restitution, and confiscation
showed them the shades of a stern retribution. They were not alone to
suffer, but they were the chief ones.</p>

<p>The war was over, and a new life began in Canada. The surrender of
the western posts was necessary to perfect the English occupancy, and to
receive these Major Rogers was despatched by Amherst on the 13th of
September. On the way, somewhere on the southern shore of Lake Erie,<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>
he met (November 7) Pontiac, and, informing him of the capitulation at
Montreal, the politic chief was ready to smoke the calumet with him.
Rogers pushed on towards Detroit.<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> There was some apprehension that
Belêtre, who commanded there, would rouse his Indians to resist, but the
French leader only blustered, and when (November 29) the white flag came
down and the red went up, his 700 Indians hailed the change of masters
with a yell; and it was with open-eyed wonder that the savages saw so
many succumb to so few, and submit to be taken down the lake as prisoners.
An officer was sent along the route from Lake Erie to the Ohio to
take possession of the forts at Miami and Ouatanon; but it was not till
the next season that a detachment of the Royal Americans pushed still
farther on to Michillimachinac and the extreme posts.<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a></p>

<p class="p2">There is in another chapter some account of preparations at Boston for the fatal expedition

veterans.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> An enumeration of the forces employed was printed in the <i>Boston Newsletter</i>,
no. 379 (July 16-23, 1711), and is reprinted in what is the authoritative narrative, the <i>Journal

1720,<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> partly in vindication of himself against charges of peculation and incompetency.
The failure of the expedition was charged by constant reports in England to the dilatoriness
of Massachusetts in preparing the outfit. Walker does not wholly share this conviction,
it is just to him to say; but Jeremiah Dummer, then the agent of the province
in London, thought it worth while to defend the provincial government by printing in
London, 1712 (reprinted, Boston, 1746), a <i>Letter to a noble lord concerning the late expedition

of the older statements regarding these tribal movements is in Manning F. Force’s
lecture before the Historical and Philosophical Soc. of Ohio, which was printed at Cincinnati
in 1879 as <i>Some Early Notices of the Indians of Ohio</i>. “In the latter half of the
seventeenth century, after the destruction of the Eries in 1656 by the Five Nations,” he
says, “the great basin, bounded north by Lake Erie, the Miamis, and the Illinois, west by
the Mississippi, east by the Alleghanies, and south by the headwaters of the streams that
flow into the Gulf of Mexico, seems to have been uninhabited except by bands of Shawnees,
and scarcely visited except by war parties of the Five Nations.” He then confines himself
to tracing the history of the Eries and Shawnees. He tells the story of the destruction of
the Eries, or “Nation du Chat,” in 1656; and examines various theories about remnants
of the tribe surviving under other names. The Chaouanons of the French, or Shawanoes
of the English (Shawnees), did not appear in Ohio till after 1750. Parkman<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> says: “Their
eccentric wanderings, their sudden appearances and disappearances, perplex the antiquary
and defy research.” Mr. Force adds to the investigations of their history, but still leaves,
as he says, the problem unsolved. The earliest certain knowledge places them in the second
half of the seventeenth century on the upper waters of the Cumberland, whence they
migrated northwest and northeast, as he points out in tracking different bands.</p>

<p>The claim of the English to the Ohio Valley and the “Illinois country,” as for a long
series of years the region east of the upper Mississippi and north of the Ohio was called,<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>
was based on a supposed conquest of the tribes of that territory by the Iroquois in 1672
or thereabouts. No treaty exists by which the Iroquois transferred this conquered country
to the English, but the transaction was claimed to have some sort of a registry,<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> as expressed,

[Five Nations], July 19, 1701, at Albany surrendered their beaver-hunting country
to the English, to be defended by them for the said Confederates, their heirs and successors
forever, and the same was confirmed, Sept. 14, 1728 [1726], when the Senecas,
Cayugaes, and Onondagoes surrendered their habitations from Cayahoga to Oswego and
six miles inland to the same for the same use.” The same claim is made on Mitchell’s
map<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> of the same year (1755), referring to the treaty with the Iroquois at Albany, Sept.,
1726, by which the region west of Lake Erie and north of Erie and Ontario, as well as
the belt of land from Oswego westward, was confirmed to the English.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Dinwiddie Papers</i> (vol. i. pp. 40-250) throw full light on the political purposes and
other views during this interval. Parkman had copies of them, and partial use had been
made of them by Chalmers. Sparks copied some of them in 1829, when they were in the
possession of J. Hamilton, Cumberland Place, London, and these extracts appear among
the Sparks MSS. in Harvard College library as “Operations in Virginia, 1754-57,” accompanied

which are added the Governor’s letter and a translation of the French Officer’s answer</i>,
Williamsburgh, 1754. This original edition is so rare that I have noted but two copies.<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a>
It has been used by all the historians,&mdash;Sparks, Irving, Parkman, and the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>

<p>Sparks<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> says he found the original sworn statement of Ensign Ward, who surrendered
to Contrecœur, in the Plantation Office in London, which had been sent to the government
by Dinwiddie. The French officer’s summons is in De Hass’s <i>West. Virginia</i>, p.
60, etc.</p>

<p>There is another journal of Washington, of use in this study of what a contemporary
synopsis of events, 1752-54, calls the “weak and small efforts” of the English.<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> It no
longer exists as Washington wrote it. It fell into the hands of the French at Braddock’s
defeat the next year (1755), and, translated into French, it was included in a <i>Mémoire contenant
le précis des faits, avec leurs pièces justificatives pour servir de réponse aux Observations
envoyées par les ministres d’Angleterre dans les cours de l’Europe</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> There
were quarto and duodecimo editions of this book published at Paris in 1756;<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> and the
next year (1757) appeared a re-impression of the duodecimo edition<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> and an English
translation, which was called <i>The Conduct of the late ministry, or memorial containing a
summary of facts, with their vouchers, in answer to the observations sent by the English
ministry to the Courts of Europe</i>, London, 1757.<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> Sparks says that the edition appearing
with two different New York imprints (Gaine; Parker &amp; Weyman), as <i>Memorial, containing
a summary of the facts, with their authorities, in answer to the observations sent by
the English ministry to the Courts of Europe</i>, was translated from a copy of the original
French brought by a prize ship into New York. He calls the version “worthy of little
credit, being equally uncouth in its style and faulty in its attempts to convey the sense
of the original.”<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> Two years later (1759) the English version again appeared in London,

some facts, in relation to the conduct of the late ministry.... By a patriot</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a></p>

<p>This missing journal of Washington, and other of these papers, are given in their re-Englished
form in the second Dublin edition (1757) of a tract ascribed to William Livingston:
<i>Review of the military operations in North America from the commencement
of the French hostilities on the frontiers of Virginia in 1753 to the surrender of Oswego,
1756 ... to which are added Col. Washington’s journal of his expedition to the Ohio in
1754, and several letters and other papers of consequence found in the cabinet of General
Braddock after his defeat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a></p>

the current reports, and the contemporary chronicles of the war, like Dobson’s <i>Chronological
Annals of the War</i> (1763) and Mante’s <i>Hist. of the Late War</i> (1772), give the
common impressions then prevailing. Sparks, in his <i>Washington</i> (i. p. 46; ii. pp. 25-48,
447), was the first to work up the authorities. Irving, <i>Life of Washington</i>, follows the
most available sources.<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a></p>

<p><i>A map of the most inhabited part of Virginia, drawn by Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson
in 1751</i>, as published later by Jefferys, and included by him in his <i>General Topography
of North America and the West Indies</i>, 1768 (no. 53), shows the route of Washington
in this campaign of 1754.</p>

<p>In Pittsburgh, 1854, was published <i>Memoirs of Major Robert Stobo of the Virginia
Regiment</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> with an introduction by Neville B. Craig, following a copy of a MS., procured
by James McHenry from the British Museum. The publication also included, from the
Pennsylvania Archives, copies of letters (July 28, 1754), with a plan of Duquesne which
Stobo sent to Washington while himself confined in that fort as a hostage, after the capitulation
at Fort Necessity, as well as a copy of the articles of surrender.<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> These letters
of Stobo were published by the French government in their <i>Précis des Faits</i>, where his
plan of the fort is called “exact.”</p>

<p class="p2">The most extensive account of the battle of Monongahela and of the events which led
to it is contained in a volume published in 1855, by the Pennsylvania Historical Society,
as no. 5 of their <i>Memoirs</i>, though some copies appeared independently. It is ordinarily
quoted as Winthrop Sargent’s <i>Braddock’s Expedition</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> The introductory memoir goes
over the ground of the rival territorial claims of France and England, and the whole narrative,
including that of the battle itself (p. 112, etc.), is given with care and judgment.
Then follow some papers procured in England for the Penna. Historical Society by Mr.
J. R. Ingersoll. The first of these is a journal of Robert Orme, one of Braddock’s aids,
which is no. 212 of the King’s MSS., in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> It begins at Hampton on
Braddock’s arrival, and ends with his death, July 13. It was not unknown before, for
Bancroft quotes it. Parkman later uses it, and calls it “copious and excellent.” It is
accompanied by plans, mentioned elsewhere. There is also a letter of Orme, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
Parkman quotes from the Public Record Office, London, in a volume marked <i>America and
West Indies</i>, lxxiv.<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Admiral Keppel,<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> who commanded the fleet which brought
Braddock over, had furnished four cannon and a party of sailors to drag them. An officer
of this party seems to have been left at Fort Cumberland during the advance, and to have
kept a journal, which begins April 10, 1755, when he was first under marching orders.
What he says of the fight is given as “related by some of the principal officers that day
in the field.” The diary ends August 18, when the writer reëmbarked at Hampton. It is
this journal which is the second of the papers given by Sargent. The third is Braddock’s
instructions.<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland, as commander-in-chief, directed through Colonel Napier a
letter (November 25, 1754) to Braddock, of which we have fragments in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i>,
xxvi. 269, but the whole of it is to be found only in the French version, as published by
the French government in the <i>Précis des Faits</i>. Sargent also gives a translation of this,
collated with the fragments referred to.</p>

<p>Parkman had already told the story of the Braddock campaign in his <i>Conspiracy of
Pontiac</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> but, with the aid of some material not accessible to Sargent, he retold it with
greater fulness in his <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i> (vol. i. ch. 7), and his story must now stand
as the ripest result of investigations in which Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> and Sparks<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> had been, as well

avail himself gracefully of previous labors. The story as it first reached England<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> will
be found in the <i>Gentleman’s Mag.</i>, and, after it began to take historic proportions, is
given in Mante’s <i>Hist. of the Late War in North America</i>, London, 1772, and in Entick’s
<i>General History of the Late War</i>, London, 1772-79.<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> Braddock himself was not
a man of mark to be drawn by his contemporaries, yet we get glimpses of his rather
unenviable town reputation through the gossipy pen of Horace Walpole<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> and the confessions

<p>From Braddock’s officers we have letters and memoranda of use in the history of the
movement. The Braddock orderly books in the library of Congress (Feb. 26-June 17,
1755) are printed in the App. of Lowdermilk’s <i>Cumberland</i>, p. 495. The originals are
a part of the Peter Force Collection, and bear memoranda in Washington’s handwriting.
His quartermaster-general, Sir John St. Clair, had arrived as early as January 10, 1755, to
make preliminary arrangements for the march, and to inspect Fort Cumberland,<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> which

<p>From Braddock’s secretary, Shirley the younger, we have a letter dated May 23, 1755,
which, with others, is in the <i>Col. Rec. of Penna.</i>, vi. 404, etc. Of Washington, there is a
letter used by Parkman in the Public Record Office.<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> Of Gage, there is a letter to Albemarle
in Keppel’s <i>Life of Keppel</i>, i. 213, and in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xxxiv., p. 367,
is a statement which Gage prepared for the use of Chalmers. A letter of William Johnston,
commissary, dated Philadelphia, Sept. 23, 1755, is in the <i>Eng. Hist. Review</i> (Jan.,
1886), vol. i. p. 150. A letter of Leslie (July 30, 1755), a lieutenant in the 44th regiment,
is printed in <i>Hazard’s Penna. Reg.</i>, v. 191; and <i>Ibid.</i>, vi. 104, is Dr. Walker’s account of
Braddock’s advance in the field. Livingston, in his <i>Rev. of Military Operations</i>, 1753-56,
gives a contemporary estimate.<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> Other letters and traditions are noted in <i>Ibid.</i>, iv. pp.

<p>The progress of events during the preparation for the march and the final retreat can
be gleaned from the <i>Dinwiddie Papers</i>. Sargent found of use the <i>Shippen MSS.</i>, in the
cabinet of the <i>Penna. Hist. Society</i>. A somewhat famous sermon, preached by Samuel
Davies, Aug. 17, 1755, before an independent troop in Hanover County, Va., prophesying
the future career of “that heroic youth Col. Washington,”<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> shows what an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
the stories of Washington’s intrepidity on the field were making upon observers. The
list of the officers present, killed, and wounded, upon which Parkman depends, is in the
Public Record Office.<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a></p>

<p>The news of the defeat, with such particulars as were first transmitted north, will be
found in the <i>New Hampshire Provincial Papers</i>, vi. 413, and in Akins’ <i>Pub. Doc. of
Nova Scotia</i>, 409, etc. The shock was unexpected. Seth Pomeroy, at Albany, July 15,
1755, had written that the latest news from Braddock had come in twenty-five days, by an
Indian a few days before, and it was such that, in the judgment of Shirley and Johnson,
Braddock was at that time in the possession of Duquesne. (<i>Israel Williams MSS.</i>, i.
p. 154.) Governor Belcher announced Braddock’s defeat July 19, 1755. <i>New Jersey Archives</i>,
viii., Part 2d, 117. In a letter to his assembly, Aug. 1 (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 119), he says:
“The accounts of this matter have been very various, but the most authentic is a letter
from Mr. Orme wrote to Gov. Morris, of Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>Governor Sharp’s letters to Lord Baltimore and Charles Calvert are in Scharf’s <i>Maryland</i>
(i. pp. 465, 466).</p>

<p>The Rev. Charles Chauncy, of Boston, embodied the reports as they reached him (and
he might have had excellent opportunity of learning from the executive office of Governor
Shirley) in a pamphlet printed at Boston shortly after (1755), <i>Letter to a friend, giving a
concise but just account, according to the advices hitherto received, of the Ohio defeat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a></p>

<p>Two other printed brochures are of less value. One is <i>The life, adventures, and surprising
deliverances of Duncan Cameron, private soldier in the regiment of foot, late Sir
Peter Halket’s</i>. <i>3d ed., Phila.</i>, 1756 (16 pp.).<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> The other is what Sargent calls “a mere
catch-penny production, made up perhaps of the reports of some ignorant camp follower.”
The <i>Monthly Review</i> at the time exposed its untrustworthiness. It is called <i>The expedition
of Maj.-Gen’l Braddock to Virginia, ... being extracts of letters from an officer,
... describing the march and engagement in the woods</i>. London, 1755.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a></p>

<p>There was a young Pennsylvanian, who was a captive in the fort, and became a witness
of the preparation for Beaujeu’s going out and of the jubilation over the return of the
victors. What he saw and heard is told in <i>An Account of the Remarkable Occurrences
in the life and travels of Col. James Smith during his captivity with the Indians</i>, 1755-59.<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us turn now to the French accounts. The reports which Sparks used, and which

the advance of Braddock.</p>

<p class="p2">The peculiar difficulties which beset the politics of Pennsylvania and Virginia at this
time are concisely set forth by Sargent in the introduction of his <i>Braddock’s Expedition</i>
(p. 61), and by Parkman in his <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i> (vol. i. p. 329). Dulany’s letter
gives a contemporary view of these dissensions.<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a></p>

the futile attempts of the governor of Maryland to induce his assembly to furnish
supplies to the army.</p>

<p>The belief was not altogether unpopular in Pennsylvania, as well as in Virginia, that
the story of French encroachments was simply circulated to make the government support
the Ohio Company in their settlement of the country, and Washington complains that his
report of the 1753 expedition failed to eradicate this notion in some quarters.<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> In Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
there were among the Quaker population unreconcilable views of Indian management
and French trespassing, and similar beliefs obtained among the German and
Scotch-Irish settlers on the frontiers of the province, while the English churchmen and
the Catholic Irish added not a little to the incongruousness of sentiment. The rum of
the traders among the Indians further complicated matters.<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> This contrariety of views,
as well as a dispute with the proprietary governor over questions of taxation, paralyzed
the power of Pennsylvania to protect its own frontiers, when, following upon the defeat
of Braddock, the French commander thrust upon the settlements all along the exposed
western limits party after party of French and Indian depredators.<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> Dumas, now in command,

<p>For the Pennsylvania confusion, the views of the anti-proprietary party found expression

and the assembly was neglecting the petitions of the borderers for the organization of a

launched various party pamphlets at each other.<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> The <i>Col. Records of Penna.</i> (vol. vi.)

couched in the language of a demand for protection. The assembly mocked and shirked;
but the end came. A compromise was reached by the proprietaries furnishing as a free
gift the money which they denied as a tax on their estates, and Franklin undertook to
manage the defence of the frontiers, with such force and munitions as were now under
command.<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Braddock’s instructions to Shirley for the conduct of the Niagara expedition are printed
in A. H. Hoyt’s <i>Pepperrell Papers</i> (1874), p. 20. This abortive campaign does not occupy
much space in the general histories, and Parkman offers the best account. The
<i>Massachusetts Archives</i> and the legislative <i>Journal</i> of that province, as well as Shirley’s
letters, give the best traces of the governor’s efforts to organize the campaign.<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a> Some descriptive

<p class="p2">The main dependence in the giving of the story of the Lake George campaign of 1755
is, on the English side, upon the papers of Johnson himself, and they are the basis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>

was completed by a son of the same name, and published in Albany in 1865, in two volumes.<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a>
The preface states that Sir William’s papers, as consulted by the elder Stone,
consist of more than 7,000 letters and documents, which were collected from various
sources, but are in good part made up of documents procured from the Johnson family in
England, and of the Johnson MSS. presented to the N. Y. State library by Gen. John
T. Cooper.<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> An account of Johnson’s preparatory conferences with the Indians (June to

<p>The account of the fight (Sept. 8), which Johnson addressed to the governors of the

<p>The sixth volume of the <i>New York Col. Docs.</i> (London documents, 1734-1755) contains
the great mass of papers preserved in the archives of the State;<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> but reference may
also be made to vols. ii. 402, and x. 355. The <i>Mass. Archives</i> supplement them, and
show many letters of Shirley and Johnson about the campaign.<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> In the <i>Provincial Papers
of New Hampshire</i>, vol. vi., there are various papers indicating the progress of the
campaign, particularly (p. 439) a descriptive letter by Secretary Atkinson, dated Portsmouth,
December 9, 1755, and addressed to the colony’s agent in London. It embodies
the current reports, and is copied from a draft in the Belknap papers.<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a></p>

The Massachusetts assembly complained that Johnson’s chief communication
was with New York, and, as was most convenient,
he sent his chief prisoners to the seaport of that
province, while they should have been sent, as the
assembly said, to Boston, since Massachusetts bore
the chief burden of the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> It was also
complained that the £5,000 given by Parliament to
Johnson was simply deducted from the appropriation
for the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a></p>

<p>The jealousy of the two provinces was largely intensified
in their chief men. Shirley did not hide
his official eminence, and had a feeling that by naming
Johnson to the command of the Crown Point
expedition he had been the making of him. Johnson
was not very grateful, and gained over the
sympathy of De Lancey, the lieutenant-governor of
New York.<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a></p>

“The French imagined the English
army would have crossed the carrying place from
Fort Nicholson at G [B in southeast corner?] to
Fort Anne at F, and accordingly had staked
Wood Creek at C to prevent their navigation;
but Gen. Johnson, being informed of it, continued
his route on Hudson’s River to H. The
French marched from C to attack his advanced
detachments near the lake. The dotted lines
show their march. A, Lake George, or Sacrament.

<p class="pf200">A copy of the map used by Dieskau on his advance,

<p>Parkman received copies of the journal of Seth
Pomeroy from a descendant, and Bancroft had also
made use of it. A letter of Pomeroy, written to
headquarters in Boston, is preserved in the <i>Massachusetts
Archives</i>, “Letters,” iv. 109. He supposed
himself at that time the only field-officer of
his regiment left alive. The papers of Col. Israel
Williams are in the Mass. Hist. Soc. library,<a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>

addressed chiefly to his wife (1755 and 1756), are in the possession of William L.
Stone, and are printed in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xvii. 209, etc. (Apr., 1870).<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> The

<p>The Rev. Samuel Chandler, who joined the camp at Lake George in October as chaplain
of a Massachusetts regiment, kept a diary, in which he records some details of the
previous fights, as he picked them up in camp, giving a little diagram of the ambush into

them, on account of which the further pursuit of the campaign was abandoned.
Johnson’s chief of ordnance, William Eyre, advised him that his cannon were not sufficient
to attack Ticonderoga.<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> Parkman speaks of the text accompanying Blodget’s

Boston, signed T. W., dated Sept. 29, 1755, and called <i>A second Letter to a Friend; giving

finally shot, after his army’s flight, by a soldier, who thought the wounded general was
feeling for a pistol, when he was searching for his watch.<a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a></p>

<p>Daniel Dulany, in a MS. Newsletter after the fashion of the day, gives the current
accounts of the fight.<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a></p>

<p>The story of the fight had been early told (1851) by Parkman in his <i>Pontiac</i>, revised in
his second edition;<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> and was again recast by him in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> (Oct., 1884),
before the narrative finally appeared in ch. ix. of the first volume of his <i>Montcalm and
Wolfe</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a></p>

<p>On the French side,
the official report of
Dieskau<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> was used by
Parkman in a copy belonging
to Sparks, obtained
from the French
war archives, and this
with other letters of
Dieskau&mdash;one to
D’Argenson, Sept. 14;
another to Vaudreuil,
Sept. 15&mdash;can be found
in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>,
vol. x. pp. 316, 318
(Paris Documents,
1745-78),<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> as can the
reports of Dieskau’s
adjutant, Montreuil (p.
335), particularly those
of Aug. 31 and Oct. 1,
which, with other papers,
are also preserved
in the <i>Mass. Archives,
documents collected
in France</i> (MSS.), ix.
241, 265.<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> The report

well as his strictures
on Dieskau, is preserved
in the Archives

Bigot (Oct. 4, 1755),&mdash;both
of which are used
by Parkman. Cf. also
the French narratives
in the <i>Penna. Archives</i>,
2d ser., vi. 320, 324, 330.
There is also in this
same collection (p.
316) a Journal of occurrences,
July 23 to
Sept. 30, 1755, which
is also in the <i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, x. p. 337, where
are other contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
accounts, like the letter of Doreil to D’Argenson (p. 360) and those of Lotbinière (pp.
365, 369). The <i>Mémoires</i> of Pouchot is the main early printed French source; though
there was a contemporary <i>Gazette</i>, printed in Paris, which will be found in the <i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, x. p. 383.</p>

<p>A paper in the Archives de la Guerre is thought by Parkman to have been inspired
by Dieskau himself, and, in spite of its fanciful form, to be a sober statement of the
events of the campaign. It is called <i>Dialogue entre le Maréchal de Saxe et le Baron de
Dieskau aux Champs Elysées</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> Some of the events subsequently related by Dieskau
to Diderot are noticed in the latter’s <i>Mémoires</i> (1830 ed.), i. 402.</p>

<p>Henry Stevens, of London, offered for sale in 1872, in his <i>Bibliotheca Geographica</i>, no.
553, a manuscript record of events between 1755 and 1760, which came from the family of
the Chevalier de Lévis. It purports to be the annual record of the French commanders in
the field, beginning with Dieskau, for six successive campaigns. Stevens, comparing this
record of Dieskau with such of the papers as are printed in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, where
they were copied from the documents as they reached the government in France, says
that the latter are shown by the collection to have been “cooked up for the home eye in
France,” and that “we lose all sympathy for the unfortunate Dieskau.” Stevens refers
particularly to two long letters of Dieskau, Sept. 1 and 4, sent to Vaudreuil.<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The feeling was rapidly growing that the next campaign should be a vigorous one.
Gov. Belcher (Sept. 3, 1755) enforces his opinion to Sir John St. Clair, that “Canada must
be rooted out.”<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> The <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> printed papers of similar import.</p>

<p>In November, 1755, Belcher had written to Shirley, “Things look to me as if the coming
year will be the criterion whereby we shall be able to conclude whether the French
shall drive us into the sea, or whether King George shall be emperour of North America.”<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a>
In December, Shirley assembled a congress of governors at New York, and laid
his plans before them.<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> When Shirley returned to Boston in Jan., 1756, the <i>Journal</i> of
the Mass. House of Representatives discloses how active he was in preparing for his
projects.<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> Stone<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> portrays the arrangements.</p>

with the Indians, is the <i>Account of Conferences</i>, London, 1756, which may be complemented
by much in the <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, vols. i. and iv. Thomas Pownall published in
New York, in 1756, <i>Proposals for securing the friendship of the Five Nations</i>. As the
campaign went on, Johnson held conferences at Fort Johnson, July 21 (of which, under
date of Aug. 12, he prepared a journal), and attended later meetings at German Flats,
Aug. 24-Sept. 3, and again at Fort Johnson. These will be found in the <i>Penna. Archives</i>,
2d ser., vi. 461-496;<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> and in the same volume, pp. 365-376, will be found the conference
of deputies of the Five Nations, July 28, 1756, with Vaudreuil, at Montreal.<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>The early events of the year, like the capture of Fort Bull,<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> find illustrations in various

associations in Benton’s <i>Herkimer County</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span></p>

<p>The centre of preparation for the campaign during the winter was in Boston, and Parkman<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a>
shows the methods of military organization which the New England colonies, with
some detriment to efficiency employed. He finds his material for the sketch in the manuscripts
of the <i>Mass. Archives</i> (“Military”), vols. lxxv. and lxxvi., and in equivalent
printed papers in <i>R. I. Colonial Records</i>, v., and <i>N. H. Provincial Papers</i>, vi. The latter
colony issued bills this year, as they had the previous season, called Crown Point currency,
in aid of the expedition, a fac-simile of one of which is annexed.<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a></p>

<p>Another main source for these preliminaries, as well as for the routine of the campaign
later in Albany and at Lake George is the <i>Journal</i> of General John Winslow, who, after
some coquetting with Pepperrell on Shirley’s part, was finally selected for the command of
the expedition against Crown Point.<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> The second volume of this journal, which is in the
library of the Mass. Hist. Society, covers Feb.-Aug., and the third, Aug.-Dec., 1756.
They consist of transcripts of letters, orders, etc., chronologically arranged.</p>

<p>The volumes labelled “Letters” in the <i>Massachusetts Archives</i> (MSS.) contain various
letters, which depict the condition of the camps and the progress of the campaign. Parkman<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a>

<p class="p2">Shirley rightfully understood the value of Oswego to the colonies. As Parkman<a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> says,
“No English settlement on the continent was of such ill omen to the French. It not
only robbed them of the fur-trade, but threatened them with military and political, no less
than commercial ruin.” The previous French governor, Jonquière, had been particularly
instructed to compass its destruction, above all by inciting the Iroquois to do it, if possible,
for the post was a menace in the eyes of the Indians. Shirley hoped to redeem the
failure of last year, and he had the satisfaction of hearing of Bradstreet’s success in the
midst of the personal detraction which assailed him.<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> The military interest of the year,
however, centres in the siege and fall of Oswego (Aug. 14), introducing Montcalm on the
scene.<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> Capt. John Vicars, a British officer who was with Bradstreet, gives an account

<p>Of the contemporary printed sources, note must be made of the “State of facts” in the
<i>Lond. Mag.</i>, 1757, p. 14; of the <i>Conduct of General Shirley</i>, etc., p. 110; of Livingston’s
<i>Review</i>; of <i>The military history of Great Britain for 1756-57</i>. <i>Containing a letter from

<p>Of somewhat less authority is a popular book, <i>French and Indian cruelty exemplified
in the life of Peter Wilkinson</i>, with “accurate detail of the operations of the French and
English forces at the siege of Oswego.”<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> Of a more general character are the accounts

War, at Paris;<a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> the <i>Livre des Ordres</i>; Vaudreuil’s instructions to Montcalm, July 21;

the siege transmitted by Montcalm; other versions are in the <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, vol. i.</p>

<p>There was printed at Grenoble, in 1756, a <i>Relation de la prise des forts de Choueguen,
ou Oswego, &amp; de ce qui s’est passée cette année en Canada</i>. A small edition was privately
reprinted in 1882, from a copy belonging to Mr. S. L. M. Barlow, of New York.<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a> Martin,
in his <i>De Montcalm en Canada</i>, ch. iii., presents the modern French view, as also does
Garneau, <i>Hist. du Canada</i>, 4th ed., vol. ii. 251. Maurault, in his <i>Hist. des Abénakis</i>
(1866), tells the part of the Indians in the siege.</p>

<p>Of the partisan warfare conducted by Rogers and Putnam, we have the best accounts
in the reports which the former made to his commanding officer.<a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> These various reports
constitute the volume which was published in London in 1765 “for the author,”
called <i>Journals of Major Robert Rogers, containing an account of the several excursions
he made under the generals who commanded, during the late war</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> Rogers’ Journals

the account of his scout of Jan. 19, 1756, is much abridged in the composite <i>Journals</i>.</p>

<p>The exploits of Rogers are frequently chronicled in Winslow’s <i>Journal</i>, and there are
other notes in the <i>Mass. Archives</i>, vol. lxxvi. Parkman cites Bougainville’s <i>Journal</i> as
giving the French record.<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> There is a contemporary account of one of Rogers’ principal
actions, in what Trumbull<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> calls “perhaps the rarest of all narratives of Indian captivities.”
The edition which is mentioned is a second one, published at Boston in 1760, and
Sabin<a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> does not record the first. It is called <i>A plain narrative of the uncommon sufferings
and remarkable deliverance of Thomas Brown, of Charlestown in New England,
who returned to his father’s house the beginning of Jan., 1760, after having been absent
three years and about eight months; containing an account of the engagement, Jan., 1757,
in which Captain Spikeman was killed and the author left for dead</i>.</p>

<p>Of Putnam’s exploits there is a report (Oct. 9, 1755) in the <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, iv. p.
172. The <i>Life</i> of Putnam by Humphreys chronicles his partisan career, while that by
Tarbox passes it over hurriedly. Hollister’s and other histories of Connecticut give it in
outline.</p>

<p class="p2">The circulars of Pitt to the colonies, asking that assistance be rendered to Loudon, and
(Feb. 4, 1757) urging the raising of additional troops, is in <i>New Jersey Archives</i>, viii. Pt.
ii. pp. 209, 241. There are in the <i>Israel Williams MSS.</i> (Mass. Hist. Soc.) letters of
Loudon, dated Boston, Jan. 29 and Feb., 1757, respecting the organization of the next
campaign.</p>

<p>For the attack on Fort William Henry (1757) conducted by Rigaud, Parkman<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> cites,

(Mar. 26, 1757), in the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, no. 106, and in the <i>Boston Evening Post</i>, no. 1,128;
with notes of other letters in the <i>Boston News-Letter</i>, no. 2,860.</p>

<p>The best account yet published of Montcalm’s later campaign against Fort William
Henry (the Fort George of the French) is contained in the last chapter of the first volume
of Parkman’s <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a></p>

<p>On the French side there is the work of Pouchot, and Dr. Hough’s translation of it (i.
101). The <i>Rough List</i> of Mr. Barlow’s library (no. 941) shows, as the only copy known,
a <i>Relation de la prise du Fort Georges, ou Guillaume Henry, situé sur le lac Saint-Sacrement,
et de ce qui s’est passé cette année en Canada</i> (12 pp.), Paris, 1757.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the documentary evidence of the time Parkman makes full use. He secured from
the Public Record Office in London the correspondence of Webb and a letter and journal
of Colonel Frye, who commanded the Massachusetts troops, and from these he gives
extracts in his Appendix F.<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a></p>

copies of other documents from France, supplementing these, and contained in the series
of MSS. given by Mr. Parkman to the Mass. Historical Society, there are the <i>Journal</i> of
Bougainville, “a document,” says Parkman, “hardly to be commended too much,” the
diary of Malartic, the correspondence of Montcalm, Lévis, Vaudreuil, and Bigot. In
adding to the graphic details of the theme, there is a long letter of the Jesuit Roubaud,
which is printed in the <i>Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a></p>

<p>Jonathan Carver, who was a looker-on, has given an account in his <i>Travels</i>, which Parkman
thinks is trustworthy so far as events came under Carver’s eye.<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a></p>

<p>The journals of the Montresors, father and son, Colonels James and John, during their
stay in 1757-59 in the neighborhood of Forts William Henry and Edward, throw light
upon the spirit of the time.<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> They are preserved in the family in England, and, edited by
G. D. Scull, have been printed in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Coll.</i>, 1881, accompanied by heliotypes
of portraits of the two engineers.<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a></p>

<p>Living at the time, and enjoying good advantages for acquiring knowledge, Hutchinson,
in his <i>Massachusetts</i> (vol. iii. p. 60), might have given us more than he does, but his purpose
was mainly to show the effect of the campaign upon that colony. It is noticeable,
however, that he says the victims of the massacre were not many in number. Most later
writers on the English side add little or nothing not elsewhere obtainable.<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a></p>

<p>Dwight, in his <i>Travels in New England and New York</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> who remembered the event
as a child, expresses the view which long prevailed in New England, that Montcalm made
no reasonable effort to check the Indians, and emphasizes the timidity and imbecility of
Webb, who lay at Fort Edward with 6,000 men, doing nothing. Dwight narrates as from
Captain Noble, who was present, that when Sir William Johnson would gather volunteers
from Webb’s garrison to proceed to Munro’s assistance Webb forbade it.<a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the attack in the autumn (Nov. 28, 1757) on German Flats, there are the despatches
of Vaudreuil, the <i>Journal</i> of Bougainville, and papers in <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, i. 520,
and <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 672, the latter being a French summary of M. de Belêtre’s campaign.
Loudon’s despatch to Pitt, Feb. 14, 1758, is the main English source.<a name="FNanchor_1440_1440" id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a></p>

<p class="p2">While Webb held the chief command at Albany, Stanwix was organizing, with the help
of Washington, the defence along the Pennsylvania and Virginia borders, and Bouquet
further south.<a name="FNanchor_1441_1441" id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a> The lives of Washington and the histories of those provinces trace out
the events of the summer in that direction. The main thread of this history is the precarious
relation of the provinces with the Indians, and much illustrative of this connection
is found in the <i>Penna. Col. Rec.</i>, vol. vii. Dr. Schweinitz’s <i>Life of Zeisberger</i> and the various
Moravian chronicles show how that people strove to act as intermediaries.</p>

<p>The Delawares had not forgotten the deceit practised upon them at Albany in 1754, in
inveigling them into giving a deed of lands, and Sir William Johnson was known to be in
favor of revoking that fraudulent purchase. Conferences with the Indians were numerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
even after the spring opened.<a name="FNanchor_1442_1442" id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> Johnson received the deputies of the Shawanese and
Delawares at Fort Johnson in April, and concluded a treaty with them.<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a></p>

<p>It boded no good that the Six Nations also, in April, had sent deputies to Vaudreuil,
and all through the spring the region north of the Mohawk was the scene of rapine.<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> The
truth was, the successes of the French had driven the westerly tribes of the Six Nations
into a neutrality, which might turn easily into enmity, and to confirm them in their passiveness,
and to incite the Mohawks and the easterly tribes into active alliance, Johnson,
who knew his life to be in danger, summoned the deputies of the confederacy to meet him
at Johnson Hall on the 10th of June. His journal for some time previous to the meeting
is printed by Stone.<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a> Johnson accomplished all he could hope for. His answer to the
Senecas of June 16 is in the <i>Penna. Archives</i>, vi. 511. Under his counsel, the final conclusion
with the Indians farther south was reached in a conference at Easton, in Pennsylvania,
in July and August.<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Of the defeat of Rogers in March, which opened the campaign of 1758, his own report
after he got into Fort Edward, printed at the time in the newspapers, is mainly given in
his <i>Journals</i>, together with a long letter of two British regular officers who accompanied
him, and who in the fight escaped capture, but wandered off in the woods, till hunger
compelled them to seek the French fort, whence by a flag of truce they despatched (Mar.
28) their narrative. The French accounts are derived from the usual documentary
sources as indicated by Parkman (ii. p. 16).</p>

<p class="p2">The English historians of the war in Europe all describe the change in political feeling

<p class="p2">The official reports on the English side of the fight on July 8th are in the Public Record
Office. The letter which Abercrombie addressed to Pitt from Lake George, July 12,
as it appeared in the <i>London Gazette Extraordinary</i>, Aug. 22, is printed in the <i>N.Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, x. 728. Dwight represents the opinions of Abercrombie’s generalship as current
in the colonies,<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> and we read in Smith’s <i>New York</i>, vol. ii. p. 264, that the difficulty “appeared
to be more in the head than the body.” The diary of William Parkman, a youth
of seventeen, who was in a Massachusetts regiment, reflects the charitable criticism of
his troops, when the diarist calls their commander “an aged gentleman, infirm in body
and mind.”<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> We have various other descriptions and diaries from officers engaged.<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a></p>

<p>Of the Frontenac expedition, Bradstreet’s own report to Abercrombie is in the Public
Record Office. Parkman uses it, as well as letters in the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, no. 182; <i>Boston
Evening Post</i>, no. 1,203; <i>Boston News-Letter</i>, no. 2,932; <i>N. H. Gazette</i>, no. 104. The
articles of capitulation are in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 826. Smith (<i>New York</i>, ii. 266),

<p>On the French side, there are the official documents, the <i>Mémoire sur la Canada</i>,
1749-60 (published by the Lit. and Hist. Soc. of Quebec), and Pouchot, i. 162.</p>

<p>The loss of Frontenac gave rise to a disagreement between Vaudreuil and Montcalm
as to the dispositions to be made upon Lake Ontario, and the papers which passed between
them are in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 866, etc., as well as others on the conflict of
their opinions respecting the defence of Ticonderoga (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 873, etc.).</p>

<p class="p2">The main sources for the Duquesne expedition of 1758 are in the Public Record Office,

in Sparks’ <i>Washington</i> (vol. ii.) may be supplemented by the fuller text of the same,
and by others, in <i>Bouquet and Haldimand Papers</i>, in the British Museum. Washington’s
letters to Bouquet are in <i>Additional MSS.</i>, vol. 21, 641, of the British Museum, and there

<p class="p2">The concomitants of the winter of 1758-59 in Canada must be studied in order to comprehend
the inequality of the two sides in the signal campaign which was to follow. Parkman
finds the material of this study in the documents of the Archives de la Marine et
de la Guerre in Paris; in the correspondence of Montcalm, of which he procured copies
from the present representative of his family, including the letters of Bougainville<a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>

in Canada are given in the <i>Considérations sur l’État présent du Canada</i>, published
by the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec in 1840, sometimes cited as Faribault’s
<i>Collection de Mémoires</i>, no. 3. Further use may be made of <i>Mémoire sur le Canada</i>,

<p>The comparative inequality of the two combatants was a fruitful subject of inquiry
then, especially upon the French side. There is in the <i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d series, vi.
554, a French <i>Mémoire</i>, setting forth their respective positions, needs, and resources,
dated January, 1759, and similar documents are given in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 897, 925,
930.</p>

<p>Later writers, with the advantage of remoteness, have found much for comment in the
several characteristics, experiences, aims, and abilities of the two warring forces. These
are contrasted in Warburton’s <i>Conquest of Canada</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> Judge Haliburton<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> points out the
great military advantages of the paternal and despotic government of Canada. Viscount
Bury, in his <i>Exodus of the Western Nations</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> compares the outcome of their opposing
systems. Parkman gives the last chapter of his <i>Old Régime in Canada</i> to a vigorous exposition
of the subject. The institutional character of the English colonists, developed
from the circumstances of their life, is compared with the purpose of the French colonists
to reproduce France, in E. G. Scott’s <i>Development of Constitutional Liberty in the English
Colonies of America</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a></p>

<p>Among the later French authors, Rameau, in his <i>France aux Colonies</i> (Paris, 1859),
writes in full consciousness of the limitations and errors of policy which deprived France
of her American colonies.<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> The efforts which were made to propitiate the Indians before
the campaign opened are explained in Stone’s <i>Life of Johnson</i>, ii. ch. v., and in the <i>N. Y.
Col. Docs.</i>, vii. 378.</p>

<p>Upon the movement to render secure the new fort at Pittsburgh, Parkman found in the
Public Record Office, in London, letters of Col. Hugh Mercer (who commanded), January-June,
1759; letters of Brigadier Stanwix, May-July;<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> and a narrative of John Ormsby,
beside a letter in the <i>Boston News-Letter</i>, no. 3,023. In the Wilkes Papers, in the <i>Historical
MSS. Commission Report, No. IV.</i>, p. 400, are long and interesting accounts of affairs
at this time in Pennsylvania, written from Philadelphia to Wilkes by Thomas Barrow
(May 1, 1759).</p>

<p>The Niagara expedition was a mistake, in the judgment of some military critics, since
the troops diverted to accomplish it had been used more effectually in Amherst’s direct
march to Montreal. More expedition on that general’s part in completing his direct march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
would have rendered the fall of Niagara a necessity without attack. Perhaps the risk of
leaving French forces still west of Niagara, ready for a siege of Fort Pitt, is not sufficiently
considered in this view.<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a></p>

<p>The Public Record Office yields Amherst’s instructions and letters to Prideaux, and
the letters of Johnson to Amherst. Stone<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> prints Johnson’s diary of the expedition, and

<p>On the French side, the account in Pouchot’s <i>Mémoires sur la dernière guerre</i><a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> is that

the French Archives are in the Parkman MSS. The English found in the fort a French
journal (July 6-July 24, 1759), of which an English version was printed in the <i>N. Y. Mercury</i>,
Aug. 20, 1759. It is also given in English in the <i>Hist. Mag.</i> (March, 1869), xv.
p. 199.</p>

<p>For the Oswego episode, beside Pouchot,<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> see <i>Mémoire sur le Canada</i>, 1749-60, and a
letter in the <i>Boston Evening Post</i>, no. 1,248.</p>

<p>The best recent accounts are in Parkman’s <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>, ii. ch. 26; Warburton’s
<i>Conquest of Canada</i>, ii. ch. 9, and Stone’s <i>Life of Johnson</i>, vol. ii.</p>

<p>Johnson’s diary, as given by Stone,<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a> shows how undecided, under Amherst’s instructions,
Gage was about attacking the French at La Galette, on the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Gage, who, in August and September, 1759, was at Oswego, was much perplexed with
the commissary and transportation service, but got relief when Bradstreet undertook to
regulate matters at Albany.<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a></p>

<p class="p2">While the expeditions of Stanwix and Prideaux constituted the left wing of the grand
forward movement, that conducted by Amherst himself was the centre.</p>

<p>The letters of Amherst to Pitt and Wolfe are in the Public Record Office in London,<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
as well as a journal of Colonel Amherst, a brother of the general. Mante and Knox
afford good contemporary narratives.<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a></p>

<p>The best general historians are Parkman (ii. 235, etc.), Bancroft (orig. ed., iv. 322; final
revision, ii. 498); Warburton’s <i>Conquest of Canada</i>, ii. ch. 8. For local associations, see
Holden’s <i>Hist. of Queensbury</i>, p. 343.<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a></p>

<p>Bourlamaque’s account of his retreat is in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 1,054. Pitt’s letter, when
he learned that Amherst had abandoned the pursuit, is in <i>Ibid.</i>, vii. 417.</p>

<p>Rogers sent to Amherst a letter about his raid upon the St. Francis village, which was
written the day after he reached the settlements on the Upper Connecticut, and it makes
part of his <i>Journals</i>. The story was the subject of recitals at the time in the provincial
newspapers, like the <i>New Hampshire Gazette</i> and the <i>Boston Evening Post</i>. Hoyt, in his
<i>Antiquarian Researches</i> (p. 302), adds a few particulars from the recollections of survivors.<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a></p>

<p>In coming to the great victory which virtually closed the war on the Heights of Abraham,
we can but be conscious of the domination which the character of Wolfe holds over
all the recitals of its events, and the best source of that influence is in the letters which
Wright has introduced into his life of Wolfe.<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span></p>

<p>To the store of letters in Wright, Parkman sought to add others from the Public Record
Office, beside the secret instructions given by the king to Wolfe and Saunders. The
despatches of Wolfe, as well as those of Saunders, Monckton, and Townshend, are found,
of course, in the contemporary magazines. A few letters of Wolfe, not before known,
preserved among the Sackville Papers, have recently been printed in the <i>Ninth Report</i>
of the Hist. MSS. Commission, Part iii. pp. 74-78. (<i>Brit. Doc. Reports</i>, 1883, vol.
xxxvii.)<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a></p>

<p>There is a printed volume which is known as <i>Wolfe’s instructions to young officers</i> (2d
ed., London, 1780), which contains his orders during the time of his service in Canada.
Manuscript copies of it, seemingly of contemporary date, are occasionally met with, and
usually begin with orders in Scotland in 1748, and close with his last order on the “Sutherland,”
Sept. 12, 1759.<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> The general orders of the Quebec campaign, given at greater
length than in these <i>Instructions</i>, have been printed in the <i>Hist. Docs., 4th ser.</i>, published
by the Lit. and Hist. Soc. of Quebec. Various orders are given in the <i>Address</i>
of Lorenzo Sabine, on the centennial of the battle.<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a></p>

<p>A large number of contemporary journals and narratives of the siege of Quebec, both
on the English and French sides, have been preserved, most of which have now been
printed.<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span></p>

<p>The letters of Montcalm in the Archives de la Marine mostly pertain to events antecedent
to the investment of Quebec. The letters of Vaudreuil are in the Archives Nationales,<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
while those of Bigot, Lévis, and Montreuil are in the Archives de la Marine et
de la Guerre.<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a></p>

<p>Parkman has a note<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a> on the contemporary accounts of Montcalm’s death<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> and burial,
and in the <i>Mercure Français</i> is an <i>éloge</i> on the French general, which is attributed to
Doreil. Some recollections of Montcalm in his last hours are given in a story credited
to Joseph Trahan, as told in the <i>Revue Canadienne</i>, vol. iv. (1867, p. 850) by J. M. Lemoine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
in a paper called “Le régiment des montagnards écossais devant Quebec, en 1759,”
which in an English form, as “Fraser’s Highlanders before Quebec,” is given in Lemoine’s
<i>Maple Leaves</i>, new series, p. 141.</p>

<p>There is a story, told with some contradictions, that Montcalm entrusted some of his
letters to the Jesuit Roubaud. Parkman, in referring to the matter, cites<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> Verreau’s report
on the Canadian Archives (1874, p. 183), and the “Deplorable Case of M. Roubaud,”
in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xviii. 283.<a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a></p>

<p>Referring to the principal English contemporary printed sources, Parkman (ii. 194) says
that Knox, Mante, and Entick are the best. Knox’s account is reprinted by Sabine in an
appendix. Using these and other sources then made public, Smollett has told the story
very intelligently in his <i>History of England</i>, giving a commensurate narrative in a general
way, and has indicated the military risks which the plan of the campaign implied.
The summary of the <i>Annual Register</i><a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> is well digested.</p>

<p>In the <i>Public Documents of Nova Scotia</i> there are papers useful to the understanding
of the fitting out of the expedition.</p>

<p>Jefferys intercalated in 1760, in his <i>French Dominions in North America</i>, sundry
pages, to include such a story of the siege as he could make at that time.<a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a></p>

<p>Of the later English writers on the siege, it is enough barely to mention some of them.<a name="FNanchor_1510_1510" id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span></p>

<p>Parkman first told the story in his <i>Pontiac</i> (vol. i. 126), erring in some minor details,
which he later corrected when he gave it more elaborate form in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>
(1884), and engrafted it (1885) in final shape in his <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i> (vol. ii.).</p>

<p>The recent histories of Canada, like Miles’, etc., and such general works as Beatson’s
<i>Naval and Mil. Memoirs</i> (ii. 300-308), necessarily cover the story; and there is an essay
on Montcalm by E. S. Creasy, which originally appeared in <i>Bentley’s Magazine</i> (vol.
xxxii. 133).<a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> Carlyle repeats the tale briefly, but with characteristic touches, in his <i>Friedrich
II.</i> (vol. v. p. 555).</p>

<p>On the French side the later writers of most significance, beside the general historian
of Canada, Garneau,<a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> are Felix Martin in his<i> De Montcalm en Canada</i> (1867), ch. 10,
which was called, in a second edition, <i>Le Marquis de Montcalm et les dernières années de
la colonie Française au Canada</i>, 1756-1760 (3d ed., Paris, 1879); and Charles de Bonnechose
in his <i>Montcalm et le Canada Français</i>, which appeared in a fifth edition in 1882.<a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a></p>

<p>As to the forces in the opposing armies, and the numbers which the respective generals
brought into opposition on the Heights of Abraham, there are conflicting opinions. Parkman<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a>
collates the varying sources. Cf. also Martin’s <i>De Montcalm en Canada</i>, p. 196;
Miles’ <i>Hist. of Canada</i>, app., etc.; <i>Collection de Manuscrits</i> (Quebec), iv. 229, 230.</p>

<p>The record of the council of war (Sept. 15) which Ramezay held after he found he had
been left to his fate by Vaudreuil is given in Martin’s <i>De Montcalm en Canada</i> (p. 317),
and in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 1007. Ramezay prepared a defence against charges of too
easily succumbing to the enemy, and this was printed in 1861 by the Lit. and Hist. Soc. of
Quebec, as <i>Mémoire du Sieur de Ramezay, Commandant à Quebec, au sujet de la reddition
de cette ville, le 18 septembre, 1759, d’après un manuscrit aux Archives du Bureau
de la Marine à Paris</i>. The paper is accompanied by an appendix of documentary proofs,
including the articles of capitulation, which are also to be found in the appendix of Warburton’s
<i>Conquest of Canada</i> (vol. ii. p. 362), <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 1011, and in Martin (p.
317).</p>

<p>It has been kept in controversy whether Vaudreuil really directed Ramezay to surrender,<a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a>

in the evening, Sept. 13, instructing him to hoist the white
flag when his provisions failed, is in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x.
1004.</p>

<p>General Townshend returned to England, and when he
claimed more than his share of the honors<a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> a <i>Letter to
an Honourable Brigadier General</i> (London, 1760) took
him sharply to task for it, and rehearsed the story of
the fight.<a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> This tract was charged by some upon Charles
Lee, but when it was edited by N. W. Simons, in 1841,
an attempt by parallelisms of language, etc., was made to
prove the authorship of Junius in it. It was answered
by <i>A refutation of a letter to an Hon. Brigadier by an
officer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> Parkman calls it “angry, but not conclusive.”
There were other replies in the <i>Imperial Magazine</i>, 1760.
Sabine, in his address, epitomizes the statements of both
sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 17th of January, 1760, Pitt addressed Amherst respecting the campaign of the
following season,<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> and on April 27th Amherst addressed the Indians in a paper dated Fort
George, N. Y., April 27.<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> Letters had passed between Amherst and Johnson in March,
about the efforts which were making by a conference at Fort Pitt to quiet the Indians in
that direction.<a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> Later there were movements to scour the country lying between Fort Pitt
and Presqu’isle, as shown in the Aspinwall Papers,<a name="FNanchor_1522_1522" id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> where<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> there is a fac-simile of a
sketch of the route from Fort Pitt, passing Venango and Le Bœuf, which Bouquet sent
to Monckton in August, 1760.</p>

<p>The earliest description of this country after it came into English hands is in a journal
(July 7-17, 1760) by Capt. Thomas Hutchins, of the Sixtieth Regiment, describing a
march from Fort Pitt to Venango, and from thence to Presqu’isle, which is printed in
the <i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i> (ii. 849).</p>

<p>Bourlamaque, in a <i>Mémoire sur Canada</i>, which he wrote in 1762, presents Quebec as
the key to the military strength of the province.<a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a></p>

<p>The interest of the winter and spring lies in the vigorous efforts of Lévis to recover
Quebec. The English commander, Murray, kept a journal from the 18th of September
till the 25th of May. The original was in the London War Office, and Miles used a copy
from that source. Parkman records it as now being in the Public Record Office,<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> and
says it ends May 17; and the reprint of the Lit. and Hist. Soc. of Quebec credits it to the
same source, in their third series (1871).</p>

<p>Parkman<a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a> refers to a plan among the King’s Maps (Brit. Mus.) of the battle and situation
of the British and French on the Heights of Abraham, 28 April, 1760.</p>

<p>This engagement is sometimes called the battle of Sillery, though the more common
designation is the battle of Ste. Foy.</p>

<p>Murray’s despatch to Amherst, April 30, is among the Parkman Papers, and that to Pitt,
dated May 25, 1760, is in Hawkins’ <i>Picture of Quebec</i>, and in W. J. Anderson’s <i>Military
Operations at Quebec from Sept. 18, 1759, to May 18, 1760</i>, published by the Lit. and
Hist. Soc. of Quebec (1869-70), and also separately. It is a critical examination of the
sources of information respecting the battle, particularly as to the forces engaged. Parkman
(ii., app., p. 442) examines this aspect also.</p>

<p>We have on the English side the recitals of several eye-witnesses. Knox<a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> was such.
So were Mante, Fraser, and Johnson; the journals of the last two are those mentioned on
a preceding page. Parkman, who gives a list of authorities,<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> refers to a letter of an officer
of the Royal Americans at Quebec, May 24, 1760, printed in the <i>London Magazine</i>, and
other contemporary accounts are in the <i>Gentleman’s</i> and <i>English Magazine</i> (1760). There
is also a letter in the <i>N. Y. Geneal. and Biog. Record</i>, April, 1872, p. 94.</p>

<p>The principal French contemporary account is that of Lévis, <i>Guerre du Canada, Relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
de la seconde Bataille de Québec et du Siége de cette ville</i>,&mdash;a manuscript which, according
to Parkman, has different titles in different copies, and some variations in text.
Vaudreuil’s instructions to Lévis are in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 1069. There is a journal
of the battle annexed to Vaudreuil’s letter to Berryer, May 3, 1760, in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>,
x. 1075, 1077. The Parkman MSS. have also letters of Bourlamaque and Lévis, and
there is something to be gleaned from Chevalier Johnston and the <i>Relation</i> of the hospital
nun, already referred to.</p>

<p>Of the modern accounts by the Canadian historians, Lemoine<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a> calls that of Garneau<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a>
the best, and speaks of it as collated from documents, many of which had never then
(1876) seen the light. Smith takes a view quite opposite to Garneau’s, and Lemoine<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a>
charges him with glossing over the subject “with striking levity.”<a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a></p>

<p>Col. John Montresor was in the force which Murray led up the river to Montreal, and
we have his journal, July 14-Sept. 8, 1760, in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, 1881, p. 236.</p>

<p>For the progress of the converging armies of Amherst and Haviland, there are the histories
of Mante and Knox and the journals of Rogers. Parkman adds a tract printed in
Boston (1760), <i>All Canada in the hands of the English</i>. Beside the official documents
of the Parkman MSS., he also cites a <i>Diary of a sergeant in the army of Haviland</i>, and
a <i>Journal of Colonel Nathaniel Woodhull</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> There is a glimpse of the condition of the
country to be got from the <i>Travels and Adventures of Alexander Henry in Canada and
the Indian territory</i>, 1760-1776 (New York, 1809).</p>

<p>Amherst’s letter to Monckton on the capture of Fort Lévis is in the Aspinwall Papers
(<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xxxix. 307), and reference may be made to Pouchot (ii. 264),
Mante (303), and Knox (ii. 405).<a name="FNanchor_1534_1534" id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a></p>

<p>Parkman uses the <i>Procès verbal</i> of the council of war which Vaudreuil held in Montreal;
and the terms of the capitulation (Sept. 8, 1760) can be found in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>,
x. 1107; Miles’ <i>Canada</i>, 502; Bonnechose’s <i>Montcalm et le Canada</i> (app.); and Martin’s
<i>De Montcalm en Canada</i> (p. 327), and his <i>Marquis de Montcalm</i> (p. 321).</p>

<p>The protest which Lévis uttered against the terms of the capitulation is in the <i>N. Y.
Col. Docs.</i>, x. 1106, with his reasons for it (p. 1123).</p>

<p>The circular letter about the capitulation which Amherst sent to the governors of the
colonies is in the <i>Aspinwall Papers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1535_1535" id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a></p>

length by Smith and Warburton.</p>

<p>Gage was left in command at Montreal; Murray returned to Quebec with 4,000 men;
while Amherst, by the last of September, was in New York.<a name="FNanchor_1537_1537" id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a></p>

<p>Rogers’s own <i>Journals</i> make the best account of his expeditions westward<a name="FNanchor_1538_1538" id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a> to receive
the surrender of Detroit and the extremer posts. Parkman, who tells the story in his
<i>Pontiac</i> (ch. 6), speaks of the journals as showing “the incidents of each day, minuted
down in a dry, unambitious style, bearing the clear impress of truth.” Rogers also describes
the interview with Pontiac in his <i>Concise Account of North America</i>, Lond., 1765.

<p>Later Lieutenant Brehm was sent as a scout from Montreal to Lake Huron, thence to
Fort Pitt, and his report to Amherst, dated Feb. 23, 1761, is in the <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg., 1883</i>, p. 22.</p>

<p>Philippe Aubert de Gaspé, in <i>Les Anciens Canadiens</i> (1863), attempts, as he says, to
portray the misfortunes which the conquest brought on the greater portion of the Canadian
<i>noblesse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1541_1541" id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a> There is a sad story of the shipwreck on Cape Breton of the “Auguste,”
which in 1761 was bearing a company of these expatriated Canadians to France, and one
of them, M. de la Corne Saint-Luc, has left a <i>Journal du Naufrage de l’Auguste</i>, which
has been printed in Quebec.<a name="FNanchor_1542_1542" id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a></p>

<p>The trials of Bigot and the others in Paris elicited a large amount of details respecting
the enormities which had characterized the commissary affairs of Canada during the war.

<p>Mr. Parkman has published in <i>The Nation</i>
(Apr. 15, 1886) an account of a MS. lately acquired
by the national library at Paris, <i>Voyage
au Canada dans le Nord de l’Amérique Septentrionale
fait depuis l’an 1751 à 1761 par T. C. B.</i>,
who participated in some of the battles of the
war; but the account seems to add little of consequence
to existing knowledge, having been
written (as he says, from notes) thirty or forty
years after his return. It shows, however, how
the army store-keepers of the French made large
fortunes and lost them in the depreciation of the
Canadian paper money.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Intercolonial Congresses and Plans
of Union.</span>&mdash;The confederacy which had been
formed among the New England colonies in
1643 had lasted, with more or less effect, during
the continuance of the colonial charter of Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_1544_1544" id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a>
As early as 1682 Culpepper, of Virginia,
had proposed that no colony should make
war without the concurrence of Virginia, and
Nicholson, eight or ten years later, had advocated
a federation. In 1684 there had been a
convention at Albany, at which representatives
of Massachusetts, New York, Maryland, and
Virginia had met the sachems of the Five Nations.<a name="FNanchor_1545_1545" id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a>
In 1693 Governor Fletcher, by order of
the king, had called at New York a meeting of
commissioners of the colonies, which proved
abortive. Those who came would not act, because
others did not come. In 1694 commissioners
met at Albany to frame a treaty with the
Five Nations, and Massachusetts, Connecticut,
New York, and New Jersey were represented.
A journal of Benjamin Wadsworth, who accompanied
the Massachusetts delegates, is printed
in the <i>Mass. Hist. Collections</i>, xxii. 102. This
journal was used by Holmes in his <i>Amer. Annals</i>,
2d ed., i. p. 451.</p>

<p>Such were the practical efforts at consolidating
power for the common defence, which the
colonies had taken part in up to the end of the
seventeenth century. We now begin to encounter
various theoretical plans for more permanent
unions.<a name="FNanchor_1546_1546" id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> In 1698 William Penn devised a scheme
which is printed in the <i>New York Colonial Documents</i>,
iv. 296. In the same year Charles
Davenant prepared a plan which is found in
Davenant’s <i>Political and Commercial Works</i>, vol.
ii. p. 11.<a name="FNanchor_1547_1547" id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> In 1701 we find a plan, by a Virginian,
set forth in an <i>Essay upon the government
of the English plantations</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1548_1548" id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a> and one of the
same year (May 13, 1701) by Robert Livingston,
suggesting three different unions, is noted in the
<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, iv. 874.</p>

<p>In 1709 another temporary emergency revived
the subject. Colonel Vetch convened the governors
of New England at New London (Oct.
14) for a concert of action in a proposed expedition
against Canada, but the failure of the fleet
to arrive from England cut short all effort.<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a>
Again in 1711 (June 21) the governors of New
England assembled at the same place, to determine
the quotas of their respective colonies for
the Canada expedition, planned by Nicholson;
and later in the year, the same New England
governments invited New York to another conference,
but it came to naught.</p>

<p>In 1721 there was a plan to place a captain-general
over the colonies. (Cf. a Representation
of the Lords of Trade to the King, in <i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, v. p. 591.)</p>

<p>On Sept. 10, 1722, Albany was the scene of another
congress, at which Pennsylvania and New
York joined to renew a league with the Five Nations;
and a few days later (Sept. 14), Virginia
having joined them, they renewed the conference.
(Cf. <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, v. 567.)</p>

<p>The same year, 1722, Daniel Coxe,<a name="FNanchor_1550_1550" id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> in his
<i>Carolana</i>, offered another theory of union.</p>

<p>In June, 1744, George Clinton, of New York,
submitted to a convocation of deputies from Massachusetts
a plan of union something like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
early New England confederacy. The Six Nations
sent their sachems.</p>

<p>On July 23, 1748, there was another conference
for mutual support at Albany, at which the Six
Nations met the deputies of New York and Massachusetts.</p>

<p>In 1751, Clinton, of New York, invited representatives
of all the colonies from New Hampshire
to South Carolina to meet the Six Nations
for compacting a league. The journal of the
commissioners is in the <i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxxviii.
160.<a name="FNanchor_1551_1551" id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a></p>

<p>In 1751, Archibald Kennedy, in his tract <i>The
importance of gaining and preserving the friendship
of the Indians to the British interest considered</i>,
N. Y., 1751, and London, 1752 (Carter-Brown,
iii. 955, 975), developed a plan of his
own.<a name="FNanchor_1552_1552" id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a></p>

<p>In 1752 Governor Dinwiddie advocated distinct
northern and southern confederacies.</p>

<p>In June, 1754, the most important of all these
congresses convened at Albany,<a name="FNanchor_1553_1553" id="FNanchor_1553_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> under an order
from the home government. The chief instigator
of a union was Shirley,<a name="FNanchor_1554_1554" id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> and the most important
personage in the congress was Benjamin
Franklin, who was chiefly instrumental in framing
the plan finally adopted, though it failed in
the end of the royal sanction as too subversive
of the royal prerogative, while it lost the support
of the several assemblies in the colonies
because too careful of the same prerogative.
Franklin himself later thought it must have hit
a happy and practicable mean, from this diversity
of view in the crown and in the subject.</p>

<p>This plan, as it originally lay in Franklin’s
mind, is embodied in his “Short Hints towards
a Scheme for uniting the Northern Colonies,”
which is printed in <i>Franklin’s Works</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1555_1555" id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> This
draft Franklin submitted to James Alexander
and Cadwallader Colden, and their comments
are given in <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 28, 30, as well as Franklin’s
own incomplete paper (p. 32) in explanation.</p>

<p>It was Franklin’s plan, amended a little, which
finally met with the approval of all the commissioners
except those from Connecticut.</p>

<p>This final plan is printed, accompanied by
“reasons and motives for each article,” in
Sparks’s ed. of <i>Franklin’s Works</i>, i. 36.<a name="FNanchor_1556_1556" id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a></p>

<p>An original MS. journal of the congress is
noted in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, iii. no.
1,067. The proceedings have been printed in
O’Callaghan’s <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, ii. 545; in the
<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vi. 853; in <i>Pennsylvania Col.
Records</i>, vi. 57; and in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Collections</i>,
xxv. p. 5, but this last lacks the last day’s
proceedings. Cf. rough drafts of plans in <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i>, vii. 203, and <i>Penna. Archives</i>, ii. 197;
also see <i>Penna. Col. Rec.</i>, v. 30-97. There are
some contemporary extracts from the proceedings
of the congress of 1754 in a volume of <i>Letters
and Papers</i>, iv. (1721-1760), in Mass. Hist.
Soc. Library.</p>

<p>We have four accounts of the congress from
those who were members.<a name="FNanchor_1557_1557" id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span></p>

<p>Pownall read (July 11, 1754) at the congress
a paper embracing “Considerations towards a
general plan of measures for the colonies,”
which is printed in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vi. 893, and
in <i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., vi. 197.</p>

<p>At the same time William Johnson brought
forward a paper suggesting “Measures necessary
to be taken with the Six Nations for defeating
the designs of the French.” It is printed
in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vi. 897; <i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d
ser., vi. 203.</p>

<p>Shirley (Oct. 21, 1754) wrote to Morris, of
Pennsylvania, urging him to press acquiescence
in the plan of union. (<i>Penna. Archives</i>, ii.
181.)</p>

<p>Shirley’s own comments on the Albany plan
are found in his letter, dated Boston, Dec. 24,
1754, and directed to Sir Thos. Robinson, which
is printed in the <i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., vi. 213,
and in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vi. 930. During this
December Franklin was in Boston, and Shirley
showed to him the plan, which the government
had proposed, looking to taxing the colonies for
the expense of maintaining the proposed union.
Franklin met the scheme with some letters, afterwards
brought into prominence when taxation
without representation was practically enforced.
These Franklin letters were printed in a London
periodical in 1766, and again in <i>Almon’s Remembrancer</i>
in 1776. They can best be found in
Sparks’s ed. of <i>Franklin’s Works</i>, vol. iii. p. 56.<a name="FNanchor_1558_1558" id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a></p>

<p>Livingston’s references to the congress are in
his <i>Review of Military Operations</i> (<i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</i>, vii. 76, 77).</p>

<p>A list of the delegates to the congress is given
in <i>Franklin’s Works</i>, iii. 28, in Foster’s <i>Stephen
Hopkins</i>, ii. 226, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The report of the commissioners on the part
of Rhode Island is printed in the <i>R. I. Col. Records</i>,
v. 393. The report of the commissioners
of Connecticut, with the reasons for rejecting the
plan of the congress, is in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>,
vii. 207, 210.</p>

<p>There is much about the congress in the <i>Doc.
Hist. New York</i>, i. 553-54; ii. 545, 564, 570-71,
589-91, 605, 611-15, 672.</p>

<p>Of the later accounts, that given by Richard
Frothingham in his <i>Rise of the Republic</i> is the
most extensive and most satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_1559_1559" id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a></p>

<p>After the Albany plan had been rejected by
the Massachusetts assembly, another plan, the
MS. of which in Hutchinson’s hand exists in the
<i>Mass. Archives</i>, vi. 171,<a name="FNanchor_1560_1560" id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> was brought forward in
the legislature. It was intended to include all
the colonies except Nova Scotia and Georgia.
It failed of acceptance. It is printed in the appendix
of Frothingham’s <i>Rise of the Republic</i>.</p>

<p>Pownall suggested, in his <i>Administration of
the Colonies</i>, a plan for establishing barrier colonies
beyond the Alleghanies, settling them with
a population inured to danger, so that they
could serve as protectors of the older colonies,
in averting the enemy’s attacks. Franklin shared
his views in this respect. (Cf. <i>Franklin’s Works</i>,
iii. 69, and also <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, ii. 301,
vi. 197.)</p>

<p>Among the Shelburne Papers (<i>Hist. MSS.
Commissioners’ Report</i>, no. 5, p. 218) is a paper
dated at Whitehall, Oct. 29, 1754, commenting
upon the Albany congress, and called “A Representation<a name="FNanchor_1561_1561" id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a>
to the King of the State of the
Colonies,” and “A Plan for the Union of the
Colonies,” signed August 9, 1754, by Halifax
and others.<a name="FNanchor_1562_1562" id="FNanchor_1562_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a> This was the plan already referred
to, presented by the ministry in lieu of the one
proposed at Albany, which had been denied.
Bancroft (<i>United States</i>, orig. ed., iv. 166) calls
it “despotic, complicated, and impracticable.”
It is named in the draft printed in the <i>New
Jersey Archives</i>, 1st ser., viii., Part 2d, p. 1, as a
“Plan by the Lords of Trade of general concert
and mutual defence to be entered into by the
colonies in America.”</p>

<p>In the interval before it became a serious
question of combining against the mother country,
two other plans for union were urged.
John Mitchell (<i>Contest in America</i>) in 1757 proposed
triple confederacies, and in 1760 a plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
was brought forward by Samuel Johnson. (<i>N. Y.
Col. Docs.</i>, vii. 438.)</p>

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Cartography of the St. Lawrence
and the Lakes in the Eighteenth Century.</span>&mdash;Various
extensive maps of the St. Lawrence
River were made in the eighteenth century.
Chief among them may be named the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is noted in the <i>Catal. of the Lib. of Parliament</i>
(Toronto, 1858, p. 1619, no. 65) a MS.
map of the St. Lawrence from below Montreal
to Lake Erie, which is called “excellent à consulter,”
and dated 1728.</p>

<p>Popple’s, in 1730, of which a reduction is
given in Cassell’s <i>United States</i>, i. 420.</p>

<p>A “Carte des lacs du Canada, par N. Bellin,

<p>A map of Lake Ontario by Labroguerie (1757)
is noted in the <i>Catal. of the King’s Maps</i> (Brit.
Mus.), ii. 112.</p>

<p>General Amherst caused sectional maps to be
made by Captain Holland and others, which are
noted in the <i>Catal. of the King’s Maps</i> (Brit.
Mus.), i. 608.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the conquest of 1760, General
Murray directed Montresor to make a map of
the St. Lawrence from Montreal to St. Barnaby
Island. This is preserved. (<i>Trans. Lit. and
Hist. Soc. of Quebec</i>, 1872-73, p. 99.)</p>

<p>Maps in Bellin’s <i>Petit Atlas Maritime</i>, 1764
(nos. 4 to 8).</p>

<p>Jefferys’ map of the river from Quebec down,
added to a section above Quebec, based on D’Anville’s
map of 1755, is in Jefferys’ <i>Gen. Topog. of
North America, etc.</i>, 1768, nos. 16, 17.</p>

<p>The edition of 1775 is called <i>An exact Chart
of the River St. Lawrence from Fort Frontenac
to Anticosti (and Part of the Western Coast of the
Gulf of St. Lawrence), showing the Soundings,
Rocks, and Shoals, with all necessary Instructions

etc., by T. Jefferys</i>. It measures 24 × 37 inches,
and has particular Charts of the Seven Islands;
St. Nicholas, or English Harbor; the Road of
Tadoussac; Traverse, or Passage from Cape
Torment.</p>

<p>A map engraved by T. Kitchen, in Mante’s
<i>Hist. of the Late War</i>, London, 1772, p. 30, shows
the river from Lake Ontario to its mouth, defining
on the lake the positions of Forts Niagara,
Oswego, and Frontenac; and (p. 333) is one
giving the course of the river below Montreal.</p>

<p>In the <i>Atlantic Neptune</i> of Des Barres, 1781,
Part ii. no. 1, is the St. Lawrence in three sheets,
from Quebec to the gulf; Part ii., no. 16, has the
same extent, on a larger scale, in four sheets;
Part ii., Additional Charts, no. 8, gives the river
from the Chaudière to Lake St. Francis, in six
sheets, as surveyed by Samuel Holland.</p>

<p>Moll made a survey of the Gulf of St. Lawrence
in 1729. The most elaborate map is that
of Jefferys (1775), which measures 20 × 24 inches,
and is called <i>Chart of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
composed from a great number of Actual Surveys
and other Materials, regulated and connected by
Astronomical Observations</i>.</p>

<p>There is a chart of Chaleur Bay in the <i>North

<p>The leading English historians (Stanhope,
etc.) can be supplemented by the <i>Bedford Correspondence</i>,
vol. iii. Various claims and concessions,
made respectively by the English and
French governments, are printed from the official
records in Mills’ <i>Boundaries of Ontario</i>
(App., p. 209, etc.). See also the <i>Mémoire historique

<p>As soon as Quebec had surrendered there
grew a party in England who put Canada as a
light weight in the scales, in comparison with
Guadaloupe, in balancing the territorial claims
to be settled in defining the terms of a peace.
The controversy which followed produced numerous
pamphlets, some of which may be mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_1566_1566" id="FNanchor_1566_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span></p>

<p>The surrender of Canada was insisted upon
in 1760 in a <i>Letter addressed to two great men on
the prospect of peace, and on the terms necessary
to be insisted upon in the negotiation</i> (London);
and the arguments were largely sustained in
William Burke’s <i>Remarks on the Letter addressed
to two great men</i> (London, 1760), both of which
pamphlets passed to later editions.<a name="FNanchor_1567_1567" id="FNanchor_1567_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a></p>

<p>Franklin, then in London, complimented the
writers of these tracts on the unusual “decency
and politeness” which they exhibited amid the
party rancor of the time. This was in a voluminous
tract, which he then issued, called <i>Interest

accounts yield in value to the yearly summary
of Dodsley’s <i>Annual Register</i>.</p>

<p>Respecting the French territory of North
America, the readiest English account is Thomas
Jefferys’ <i>Natural and Civil History of the French
Dominions in North and South America</i>, London,

<p>Foremost among the special histories of the
war, which were contemporary on the French
side, is the <i>Mémoires sur la dernière guerre de
l’Amérique Septentrionale</i>, written by Pouchot, of
the regiment of Bearn, who twice surrendered
his post, at Niagara and Lévis. The book bears

was reprinted in 1876. The original MS. has a
secondary title, “Mémoires du S&mdash;&mdash; de C&mdash;&mdash;,

<p>There is a contemporary account of the campaigns,
1754-58, preserved in the Archives de la
Guerre at Paris, which is ascribed to the Chevalier
de Montreuil, and is given in English in
the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 912. In the <i>Penna. Archives</i>,
2d ser., vi. 439, it is made a part of an extensive
series of documents relating to the period
of the French occupation of western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Among the Parkman MSS. is a series called
<i>New France</i>, 1748-1763, in twelve volumes,
mainly transcripts from the French Archives,
with copies of some private papers, all supplementing
the selection which Dr. O’Callaghan
printed in his <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vol. x.</p>

<p>The papers of this period make a part of the
review given by Edmond Lareau in his “Nos
Archives,” in the <i>Revue Canadienne</i>, xii. 208,
295, 347. A paper on the “Archives of Canada,”
by a former president of the Lit. and
Hist. Society of Quebec, Dr. W. J. Anderson,
describes the labors of that society, which have
been aided by an appropriation from the government
to collect and arrange the historical
records.<a name="FNanchor_1591_1591" id="FNanchor_1591_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a> Of a collection made by Papineau

included in the publication, issued in four quarto
volumes, under the auspices of that province,
and called <i>Collection de manuscrits contenant lettres,

<p>It was a stipulation of the capitulation at
Montreal in 1760 that all papers held by the
French which were necessary for the prosecution
of the government should be handed over
by the French officials to the victors. These
are now supposed to be at Ottawa.<a name="FNanchor_1593_1593" id="FNanchor_1593_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a></p>

<p>The State of New York, in its <i>Documentary
Hist. of New York</i> and its <i>New York Col. Docs.</i>;
New Jersey, in its <i>New Jersey Archives</i>; and
Pennsylvania in its <i>Colonial Records</i> and <i>Pennsylvania
Archives</i>, have done much to help the
student by printing their important documents
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In New England, Massachusetts has done
nothing in printing; but a large part of her
important papers are arranged and indexed,
and a commission has been appointed, with an
appropriation of $5,000 a year,<a name="FNanchor_1595_1595" id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a> to complete the
arrangement, and render her documents accessible
to the student, and carry out the plan recommended
by the same commission,<a name="FNanchor_1596_1596" id="FNanchor_1596_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a> whose report
(Jan., 1885) was printed by the legislature.
It gives a synopsis of the mass of papers constituting
the archives of Massachusetts. Dr.
Geo. H. Moore, in Appendix 5 of his <i>Final
Notes on Witchcraft</i>, details what legislative action
has taken place in the past respecting the
care of these archives.</p>

<p>The other New England States have better
cared for their records of the provincial period;
New Hampshire having printed her <i>Provincial
Papers</i>, Rhode Island and Connecticut their
<i>Colonial Records</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1597_1597" id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Certain historical summaries&mdash;contemporary
or nearly so&mdash;of the English colonies are necessary
to the study of their conditions at the
outbreak and during the progress of the war.</p>

<p>First, we have an early French view in George
Marie Butel-Dumont’s <i>Histoire et Commerce des
Colonies Angloises dans l’Amérique Septentrionale</i>,
1755. A portion of it was issued in London in
a translation, as <i>The Present State of North
America</i>, Part i.<a name="FNanchor_1598_1598" id="FNanchor_1598_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a></p>

<p>The Summary of Douglass has been mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_1599_1599" id="FNanchor_1599_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> and it ends at too early a date
to include the later years of the wars now under
consideration.</p>

<p>The work of Edmund Burke, <i>An Account of
the European Settlements in America</i>, though published
in 1757, was not able to chronicle much of
the effects of the war. It has passed through
many editions.<a name="FNanchor_1600_1600" id="FNanchor_1600_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a></p>

<p>M. Wynne’s <i>General History of the British
Empire in America</i>, London, 1770,<a name="FNanchor_1601_1601" id="FNanchor_1601_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a> 2 vols., is in
some parts a compilation not always skilfully
done.</p>

<p>Smith’s <i>History of the British Dominions in
America</i> was issued anonymously, and Grahame
(ii. 253) says of it that it “contains more ample
and precise information than the composition of
Wynne, and, like it, brings down the history and
state of the colonies to the middle of the eighteenth
century. It is more of a statistical than
a historical work.”</p>

<p><i>A History of the British Dominions in North
America</i> (London, 1773, 2 vols. in quarto) was a
bookseller’s speculation, of no great authority,
as Rich determined.<a name="FNanchor_1602_1602" id="FNanchor_1602_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a></p>

<p>William Russell, the author of a <i>History of
America from its discovery to the conclusion of the
late war</i> [1763], London, 1778, 2 vols. in quarto,
was of Gray’s Inn,<a name="FNanchor_1603_1603" id="FNanchor_1603_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a>&mdash;the same who wrote the
<i>History of Modern Europe</i>, which, despite grave
defects, has had a long lease of life at the hand
of continuators. His <i>America</i> has had a trade
success, and has passed through later editions.</p>

<p><i>A New and Complete History of the British
Empire in America</i> (London) is the running-title
of a work issued in numbers in London about
1756. It was never completed, and has no title-page.<a name="FNanchor_1604_1604" id="FNanchor_1604_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a></p>

<p>Jefferys’ <i>General Topography of North America
and the West Indies</i>, London, 1768, has a
double title, French and English. It is the earliest
publication of what came later to be known
as <i>Jefferys’ Atlas</i>, in the issues of which the
plates are inferior to the impression in this
book.<a name="FNanchor_1605_1605" id="FNanchor_1605_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a></p>

<p>The special histories of two of the colonies
deserve mention, because their authors lived
during the war, and they wrote with authority
on some of its aspects. These are Thomas
Hutchinson’s <i>Hist. of Massachusetts Bay</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1606_1606" id="FNanchor_1606_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a> and
William Smith’s <i>History of the Province of New
York</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1607_1607" id="FNanchor_1607_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> The latter book, as published by its author,
came down only to 1736, though, being
written during the war, he anticipated in his
narrative some of its events. He, however, prepared
a continuation to 1762, and this was for
the first time printed as the second volume of an
edition of the work published by the New York
Hist. Society in 1829-30. In editing this second
volume, the son of the author says that his father
was “a prominent actor in the scenes described,”
which are in large part, however, the endless
quarrels of the executive part of the government
of the province with its assembly. Parkman
characterizes Smith as a partisan in his views.
Smith acknowledges his obligations to Colden
for “affairs with the French and Indians, antecedent
to the Peace of Ryswick;” and while he
follows Colden in matters relating to the English,
he appeals to Charlevoix for the French
transactions.<a name="FNanchor_1608_1608" id="FNanchor_1608_1608"></a><a href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a></p>

<p>Two special eclectic maps of the campaigns
of the war may be mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p>Bonnechose, in his <i>Montcalm et le Canada
Français</i>, 5th ed., Paris, 1882, gives a “Carte au
théâtre des opérations militaires du M<sup>r.</sup> de Montcalm,
d’après les documents de l’époque.”</p>

<p>In L. Dussieux’s <i>Le Canada sous la domination
française</i> (Paris, 1855) is a general map
“pour servir a l’histoire de la Nouvelle France,
ou du Canada, jusqu’en 1763, dressées principalement
d’après des matériaux inédits conservés
dans les Archives du ministère de la Marine, par
L. Dussieux, 1851.”</p>

<p>As an instance of the curious, perverse error
which could be made to do duty for cartographical
aids, reference may be made to a publication
of Georg Cristoph Kilian, of Augsburg, in 1760,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
entitled <i>Americanische Urquelle derer innerlichen
Kriege des bedrängten Teutschlands ... historisch

</div></div>

<p>The leading historian of Canada in the French
interests is, without question, François Xavier
Garneau, the earlier editions of whose <i>Histoire

have been mentioned elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_1610_1610" id="FNanchor_1610_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> the final revision

clearness of vision, when his national sympathies
are evoked by his story, and there are some
instances in which they accuse him of garbling
his authorities. It must be confessed, however,
that the disasters of the French do not always
elicit Garneau’s sympathy, and his own compatriots
have not all approved his reflections upon
Montcalm for his last campaign.</p>

<p>Among the later of the French writers on the
closing years of the French domination, Mr. J.
M. Lemoine, of Quebec, is conspicuous. Such
of his writings as are in English have been gathered
in part from periodicals, and principal
among them are his <i>Quebec Past and Present</i>, and
its sequel, <i>Picturesque Quebec</i>, beside his collection
of <i>Maple Leaves</i>, in two series (Quebec,
1863, 1873).<a name="FNanchor_1612_1612" id="FNanchor_1612_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a></p>

<p>The latest of the French chronicles are Eugène
Réveillaud’s <i>Histoire du Canada et des Canadiens

1884 (pp. 551, with map), and Benjamin Sulte’s
<i>Histoire des Canadiens français</i>, 1608-1880
(Montreal, 1882-1884), in eight thin quarto volumes,
with illustrations, including portraits of
the Canadian historians and antiquaries, Pierre
Boucher, Jacques Viger, Garneau, L. J. Papineau,
Michel Bibaud, Aubert de Gaspé, Ferland,
Abbé Casgrain, and E. Rameau.</p>

<p>The Abbé J. A. Maurault’s <i>Histoire des Abénakis

<p class="p2">The <i>American Annals</i> of Dr. Abiel Holmes

It is a book still to inspire confidence, and “the

Libraries in America were then scant,
but the annalist traced where he could his facts
to original sources, and when he issued his second
edition, in 1829, its revision and continuation
showed how he had availed himself of the stores
of the Ebeling and other collections which in
the interval had enriched the libraries of Harvard
College and Boston. Grahame<a name="FNanchor_1614_1614" id="FNanchor_1614_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> gives the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
book no more than just praise when he calls
it perhaps “the most excellent chronological
digest that any nation has ever possessed.”</p>

<p>The history of the colonies, which formed an
introduction to Marshall’s <i>Life of Washington</i>,

of that war which terminated in their independence</i>.</p>

          <p class="pf402">After the engraving in the Boston ed. of his <i>History</i>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>James Grahame was a Scotchman, born in
1790, an advocate at the Scottish bar, and a
writer for the reviews. By his religious and political
training he had the spirit of the Covenanters
and the ideas of a republican. In 1824
he began to think of writing the history of the
United States, and soon after entered upon the
work, the progress of which a journal kept by
him, and now in the library of Harvard College,
records. In Feb., 1827, the first two volumes,
bringing the story down to the period of
the English revolution, were published,<a name="FNanchor_1615_1615" id="FNanchor_1615_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a> and
met with neglect from the chief English reviews.
As he went on he had access to the material
which George Chalmers had collected. He finished
the work in Dec., 1829; but before he published
these closing sections a considerate notice
of the earlier two volumes appeared in
January, 1831, in the <i>North American Review</i>,
the first considerable recognition which he had
received. It encouraged him in the more careful
revision of the later volumes, which he was
now engaged upon, and in Jan., 1836, they were
published.<a name="FNanchor_1616_1616" id="FNanchor_1616_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> His health prevented his continuing
his studies into the period of the American
Revolution. In 1837 Mr. Bancroft had in his
<i>History</i> (ii. 64) animadverted on the term “baseness,”
which Grahame in his earliest volumes
had applied to John Clarke, who had procured
for Rhode Island its charter of 1663, charging
Grahame with having invented the allegations
which induced him to be so severe on Clarke.
Mr. Robert Walsh and Mr. Grahame himself
repelled the insinuation in <i>The New York American</i>,
and a later edition of Mr. Bancroft’s volume
changed the expression from “invention” to
“unwarranted misapprehension,” and Mr.
Grahame subsequently withdrew the term “baseness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>”
which had offended the local pride of
the Rhode Islanders, and wrote “with a suppleness
of adroit servility.” It is not apparent
that either historian sacrificed much of his original
intention. Josiah Quincy defends Grahame’s
view in a note to his memoir of the historian
prefixed to the Boston edition of his <i>History</i>, in
which Grahame had said he was incapable of
such dishonesty as Bancroft had charged upon
him. Bancroft wrote in March, 1846, a letter
to the <i>Boston Courier</i>, calling the retort of
Grahame a “groundless attack,” and charging
Quincy, who had edited the new edition of
Grahame, with giving publicity to Grahame’s
personal criminations. Quincy replied in a
pamphlet, <i>The Memory of the late James
Grahame, Historian, vindicated from the charges
of Detraction and Calumny, preferred against
him by Mr. George Bancroft, and the Conduct of
Mr. Bancroft towards that Historian stated and
exposed</i>, in which use was also made of material
furnished by the Grahame family, and thought
to implicate Mr. Bancroft in literary jealousy of
his rival.<a name="FNanchor_1617_1617" id="FNanchor_1617_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> Grahame was not better satisfied
with the view which Mr. Quincy had taken of
the character of the Mathers in his <i>History of
Harvard University</i>. “The Mathers are very
dear to me,” Grahame wrote to Quincy, “and
you attack them with a severity the more painful
to me that I am unable to demur to its justice.
I would fain think that you do not make
sufficient allowance for the spirit of their times.”
This difference, however, did not disturb the
literary amenities of their relations; and
Grahame, in 1839, demurred against Walsh’s
proposition to republish his <i>History</i> in Philadelphia,
for fear he might be seeming to seek a rivalry
with Mr. Bancroft on his own soil. Three
years later, July 3, 1842, Mr. Grahame died,
leaving behind him a corrected and enlarged
copy of his <i>History</i>. Subsequently this copy
was sent by his family for deposit in the library
of Harvard College, and from it, under the main
supervision of Josiah Quincy, but with the
friendly countenance of Judge Story and of
Messrs. James Savage, Jared Sparks, and William
H. Prescott, an American edition of <i>The
History of the United States of North America,
from the Plantation of the British Colonies till
their Assumption of National Independence</i>, in
four volumes, was published in Boston in 1845,
accompanied by an engraved portrait after
Healy.</p>

<p>Excluding Parkman’s series of histories, upon
which it is not necessary to enlarge here after
the constant use made of them in the critical
parts of the present volume, the most considerable
English work to be compared with his
is Major George Warburton’s <i>Conquest of Canada</i>,
edited by Eliot Warburton, and published
in London in two volumes in 1849, and reprinted
in New York in 1850. He surveys the whole
course of Canadian history, but was content
with its printed sources, as they were accessible
forty years ago.</p>

<p>Among the other general American historians
it is enough to mention in addition Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_1618_1618" id="FNanchor_1618_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a>
Hildreth,<a name="FNanchor_1619_1619" id="FNanchor_1619_1619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a> and Gay;<a name="FNanchor_1620_1620" id="FNanchor_1620_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a> and among the English,
Smollett,<a name="FNanchor_1621_1621" id="FNanchor_1621_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a> who had little but the published despatches,
as they reached England at the time,
and Mahon (Stanhope), who availed himself of
more deliberate research, but his field did not
admit of great enlargement.<a name="FNanchor_1622_1622" id="FNanchor_1622_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a> The <i>Exodus of
the Western Nations</i>, by Viscount Bury, is not
wholly satisfactory in its treatment of authorities.<a name="FNanchor_1623_1623" id="FNanchor_1623_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a></p>

<p>Henry Cabot Lodge’s <i>Short History of the
English Colonies</i> (N. Y., 1881) has for its main
purpose a presentation of the social and institutional
condition of the English colonies at the
period of the Stamp Act Congress in 1765; and
the condensed sketches of the earlier history of
each colony, which he has introduced, were imposed
on the general plan, rather unadvisedly,
to fill the requirements of the title. He says of
these chapters: “They make no pretence to
original research, but are merely my own presentation
of facts, which ought to be familiar
to every one.”</p>


<p class="p1"><b>F.</b> <span class="smcap">Bibliography of the Northwest.</span>&mdash;Concerning
the historical literature of the States
of the upper lake region and the upper Mississippi,
a statement is made in Vol. IV. p.
198, etc. Since that was written some additions
of importance have been made. The
<i>Northwest Review, a biographical and historical
monthly</i>, was begun at Minneapolis in March,
1883; but it ceased after the second number.
In Nov., 1884, there appeared the first number
of the <i>Magazine of Western History</i>, at Cleveland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span></p>

<p>The two most important monographs to be
added to the list are:&mdash;</p>

<p>S. Breese’s <i>Early history of Illinois, from 1673
to 1763, including the narrative of Marquette’s
discovery of the Mississippi. With a biographical
memoir by M. W. Fuller. Edited by T. Hoyne</i>.
Chicago, 1884; and Silas Farmer’s <i>History of
Detroit and Michigan: a chronological cyclopædia
of the past and present, including a record of the
territorial days in Michigan and the annals of
Wayne county</i>. Detroit, 1884,&mdash;the latter the
most important local history yet produced in the
West. The first volume of the <i>Final Report of
the Geological Survey of Minnesota</i>, by Winchell,
adds something to the early cartography of the
region, and gives an historical chart of Minnesota,
showing the geographical names and
their dates, since 1841. The Historical Society
of Minnesota has added a fifth volume (1885)
to the <i>Collections</i>, which is largely given to the
history of the Ojibways.</p>

<p>The Historical Society of Iowa having ceased
to publish the <i>Annals of Iowa</i> in 1874 (1863-1874,
in 12 vols.), a new series was begun in
1882 by S. S. Howe, but the society declined to
make it an official publication, and began the
issue of a quarterly <i>Iowa Historical Record</i> in
1885.</p>

<p>On the Canada side the Historical and Scientific
Society of Manitoba have been issuing
since 1882, at Winnipeg, its Reports, Publications,
and Transactions.</p>

[Céloron’s expedition was followed, in 1750,
by the visit of Christopher Gist, who was sent,
under the direction of this newly formed Ohio
Company, to prepare the way for planting English
colonists in the disputed territory. The
instructions to Gist are in the appendix of
Pownall’s <i>Topographical Description of North
America</i>. He fell in with George Croghan, one
of the Pennsylvania Scotch-Irish, then exploring
the country for the Governor of Pennsylvania;
and Croghan was accompanied by Andrew
Montour, a half-breed interpreter. The original

Charlevoix says the expedition was composed
of the “François” and “Renommée,”
and sailed October 17. According to Penicaut
the vessels were the “Marin” and “Renommée.”
The <i>Journal historique</i> states that they
sailed from Rochefort September 24. This work
is generally accurate. Perhaps there was some
authority for that date. The vessels had come
down from Rochefort to the anchorage at
Rochelle some time before this, and the date
may represent the time of sailing from Rochelle.
Margry (iv. 213) in a syllabus of the contents of
the Journal of Marin, which he evidently regarded
as a part of the original document, gives
the date of that event as September 5. In the
same volume (p. 84) there is a despatch from the
Minister to Du Guay, dated October (?) 16, in
which he says that “he awaits with impatience
the news of Iberville’s sailing, and fears that he
may be detained at Rochelle by the equinoctial
storms.”</p>

The French accounts all say that Pensacola
had been occupied by the Spaniards but a few
months, and simply to anticipate Iberville. Barcia
in his <i>Ensayo cronológico</i> (p. 316) says it was
founded in 1696.</p>

Report in Margry, iv. 118, and Journal in
Ibid., iv. 157. A third account of the Journal
of the “Marin” says there were twenty-two in
one <i>biscayenne</i>, twenty-three in the other; fifty-one
men in all (Journal in Margry, iv. 242).
The six men in excess in the total are probably
to be accounted for as the force in the canoes.
These discrepancies illustrate the confusion in
the accounts.</p>

The language used in the text is fully
justified by the accounts referred to. Students
of Indian habits dispute the despotism of the
Suns, and allege that the hereditary aristocracy
does not differ materially from what may be
found in other tribes. See Lucien Carr’s paper
on “The Mounds of the Mississippi Valley historically
considered,” extracted from <i>Memoirs
of the Kentucky Geological Survey</i>, ii. 36, <i>note</i>.

Pontchartrain to Callières and Champigny,
June 4, 1701, in Margry, v. 351. Charlevoix
speaks of Saint-Denys, who made the trip to
Mexico, as Juchereau de Saint-Denys. Dr. Shea,
in the <i>note</i>, p. 12, vol. vi. of his <i>Charlevoix</i>, identifies
Saint-Denys as Louis Juchereau de Saint-Denys.
The founder of the settlement on the
“Ouabache” signed the same name to the Memorial
in Margry, v. 350. The author of <i>Nos
gloires nationales</i> asserts (vol. i. p. 207 of his
work) that it was Barbe Juchereau who was sent
to Mexico. Spanish accounts speak of the one
in Mexico as Louis. Charlevoix says he was
the uncle of Iberville’s wife. Iberville married
Marie-Thérèse Pollet, granddaughter of Nicolas
Juchereau, Seigneur of Beauport and St. Denis
(see Tanguay). This Nicolas Juchereau had
a son Louis, who was born Sept. 18, 1676.
Martin says the two Juchereaus were relatives.</p>

on the Ouabache (Ohio), <i>Journal historique</i>,

Feb. 15, 1703, says “he will go to the ‘Ouabache,’”
in letter of Iberville to Minister (Margry,

Ouabache (Margry, v. 426-438).</p>

evidently duped by the Spaniards. Crozat was
anxious for trade. Saint-Denys arranged matters
with the authorities at Mexico, and joined in the
expedition which established Spanish missions
in the “province of Lastekas.” In these missions
he saw only hopes of trade; but the title
to the province was saved to Spain by them,
and no trade was ever permitted.</p>

Recollets, with a Frere, 2 souldiers and a Span.
woman; at Assinays or Cenis 2 Peres Recollets, 1
souldier, 1 Span. woman. The presidio which had
been 17 leagues further off now came and established
itself at 7 leagues from the Assinayes; it was composed
of a Capt<sup>n</sup>, ensign and 25 souldiers. They
reached the presidio 2 leagues W. of the Rio Bravo
where there was a Capt. Lieut. and 30 souldiers Span.
and 2 missions of St. Jean Baptiste and St. Bernard.
All the goods of St. Denys were seized and in
the end lost. On the return of Graveline and the
others they found a Span. Mission at Adayes, founded
Jan. 29, 1717.”</p>

There were outstanding, when the bank collapsed,
notes of the nominal value of 1,169,072,540
livres. Statements of the amounts in hand, of
those which had been burned, etc., showed that
there had been emitted more than 3,000,000,000
livres (Forbonnais, ii. 633).</p>

This is exclusive of an issue of 24,000

at which they were respectively issued,
amounted to 1,677,500,000 livres.</p>

The commanders of the post in the early
days of the colony have been generally spoken
of as governors. Gayarré (i. 162) says, “The
government of Louisiana was for the second
time definitely awarded to Bienville.” He was,
as we have seen, <i>lieutenant du roy</i>. As such
he was at the head of the colony for many years,
and he still held this title when he was by letter
ordered to assume command after La Mothe left
and until L’Epinay should arrive (Margry, v.
591). In 1716 he was “commandant of the
Mississippi River and its tributaries” (<i>Journal
historique</i>, etc., pp. 123, 141). His power as
<i>commandant-général</i> was apparently for a time
shared with his brother Sérigny. In a despatch
dated Oct. 20, 1719, quoted by Gayarré, he says,
“Mon frère Sérigny, chargé comme moi du commandement
de cette colonie.” M. de Vallette
Laudun, in the <i>Journal d’un voyage</i> (Paris, 1768),
on the 1st of July, 1720, says, M. de Bienville
“commands in chief all the country since the
departure of his brother, Monsieur de Sérigny.”
In 1722 Bienville applied for the “general
government” (Margry, v. 634).</p>

The Penicaut narrative apparently assigns
the year 1717 as the date of the original foundation
of New Orleans. Margry (v. 549) calls
attention in a note to the fact that the <i>Journal
historique</i>, which he attributes to Beaurain, gives
1718 as the date. Gravier, in his Introduction
to the <i>Relation du voyage des dames religieuses
Ursulines</i>, says that New Orleans was founded
in 1717. He cites in a note certain letters of
Bienville which are in the Archives at Paris;
but as he does not quote from them, we cannot
tell to what point of the narrative they
are cited as authority.</p>

“Clérac” is thus translated by authority
of Margry, v. 573, <i>note</i>. He says it means
a workman engaged in the manufacture of
tobacco, and is derived from the territory of
Clérac (Charcute-Inférieure). With this interpretation
we can understand why one of the
grants was “Celle des Cléracs aux Natchez”
(Dumont, ii. 45).</p>

Natchez is never mentioned by the French
writers except with expressions of admiration
for its soil, climate, and situation. Dumont (vol.
ii. p. 63) says “the land at Natchez is the best
in the province. This establishment had begun
to prosper.” The number of killed at the massacre
is stated at “more than two hundred”
by Father Le Petit (<i>Lettres édifiantes</i>, xx. 151).
Writers like Dumont and Le Page du Pratz
state the number at more than seven hundred.
Even the smaller number is probably an exaggeration.
The value of the tobacco produced
at Natchez is alluded to in Champigny; but the
place does not seem to have rallied from this
blow. Bossu, in 1751, speaks of the fertility of
its soil, “if it were cultivated.”</p>

<i>Lettres édifiantes et curieuses</i> (Paris, 1758),
xxviii. 59. Father Vivier says that five French
villages situated in a long prairie, bounded at
the east by a chain of mountains and by the
River Tamaroa, and west by the Mississippi, comprised
together one hundred and forty families.
These villages were (Bossu, seconde édition,
Paris, 1768, i. 145, <i>note</i>) Kaskaskia, Fort
Chartres, St. Philippe, Kaokia, and Prairie du
Rocher. There were other posts on the lines
of travel, but the bulk of the agricultural population
was here. The picture of their life given
by Breese is interesting.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Vincennes is said by some authorities to
have been founded as early as 1702. See Bancroft
(New York, 1883), ii. 186; also <i>A Geographical
Description of the United States</i> by
John Melish. C. F. Volney, the author of <i>Tableau
du climat et du sol des États-Unis d’Amérique</i>
(Paris, 1803), was himself at Poste Vincennes in
1796. He says (p. 401): “I wished to know the
date of the foundation and early history of Poste
Vincennes; but spite of the authority and credit
that some attribute to tradition, I could scarcely
get any exact notes about the war of 1757, notwithstanding
there were old men who dated back
prior to that time. It is only by estimate that I
place its origin about 1735.” In <i>Annals of the
West</i>, compiled by James R. Albach, the authorities
for the various dates are given. The post
figures in some of the maps about the middle of
the century.</p>

Pownall in his <i>Administration of the Colonies</i>
(2d ed., London, 1765, appendix, section
1, p. 24) gives a sketch of the condition of
the colonies, derived mainly from Vaudreuil’s
correspondence. He says that Vaudreuil (May
15, 1751) thought that Kaskaskia was the principal
post, but that Macarty, who was on the
spot (Jan. 20, 1752), thought the environs of
Chartres a far better situation to place this post
in, provided there were more inhabitants. “He
visited Fort Chartres, found it very good,&mdash;only
wanting a few repairs,&mdash;and thinks it ought to
be kept up.”</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a></span>
Fort Chartres is stated by Mr. Edward
G. Mason, in <i>Illinois in the Eighteenth Century</i>
(Fergus Historical Series, no. 12, p. 25), to be
sixteen miles <i>above</i> Kaskaskia. In the <i>Journal
historique</i>, etc. (Paris and New Orleans, 1831),
p. 221, the original establishment of Boisbriant
is stated to have been “eight leagues below
Kaskaskia,” and (p. 243) it is stated that it
was transferred “nine leagues <i>below</i>” the village.
French, in his <i>Louisiana Historical Collections</i>,
published a translation of a manuscript copy of
the <i>Journal historique</i> which is deposited in Philadelphia.
His translation reads that the transfer
was made to a point “nine leagues <i>above</i> Kaskaskia.”
Martin, who worked from still another
copy of the <i>Journal historique</i>, states that the
establishment was transferred to a point twenty-five
miles <i>above</i> Kaskaskia. The “au dessous”
(p. 243 of <i>Journal historique</i>, or, as ordinarily
cited, “La Harpe”) was probably a typographical
error.</p>

This ground was partly prospected by
Dutisné, who, Nov. 22, 1719, wrote to Bienville
an account of an expedition to the Missouris by
river and to the Osages and Paniouassas by
land. Bournion, whose appointment was made,
according to Dumont, in 1720, went up the
river to the Canzes, and thence to the Padoucahs
in 1724. Le Page du Pratz gives an
account of the expedition. The name of this
officer is variously given as Bournion in the
<i>Journal historique</i>, Bourgmont by Le Page du
Pratz, Bourmont by Bossu, and Boismont by

[“In the dual government of Canada the
governor represented the king, and commanded
the troops; while the intendant was charged
with trade, finance, justice, and all other departments
of civil administration. In former times
the two functionaries usually quarrelled; but
between Vaudreuil and Bigot there was perfect
harmony” (Parkman, <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>, ii.
18). Foremost among the creatures of Bigot,
serving his purposes of plunder, were Joseph
Cadet, a butcher’s son whom Bigot had made
commissary-general, and Marin, the Intendant’s
deputy at Montreal, who repaid his principal by
aspiring for his place. It was not till February,
1759, when Montcalm was given a hand in civil
affairs, that the beginning of the end of this abandoned
coterie appeared (see Ibid., ii. 37, for
sources). Upon the interior history of Canada,
from 1749 to 1760, there is a remarkable source
in the <i>Mémoires sur le Canada</i>, which was
printed and reprinted (1873) by the Literary and
Historical Society of Quebec. It reached the
committee from a kinsman of General Burton,
of the army of General Amherst, who presumably
received it from its anonymous author,
and took it to England for printing. Smith, in
his <i>History of Canada</i> (1815), had used a manuscript
closely resembling it. Parkman refers to
a manuscript in the hands of the Abbé Verreau
of Montreal, the original of which he thinks may
have been the first draught of these <i>Mémoires</i>.
This manuscript was in the Bastille at the time
of its destruction, and being thrown into the
street, fell into the hands of a Russian and was
carried to St. Petersburg. Lord Dufferin, while
ambassador to Russia, procured the Verreau copy,
which differs, says Parkman, little in substance
from the printed <i>Mémoires</i>, though changed in
language and arrangement in some parts (Parkman,
<i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>, ii. 37). The second
volume of the first series of the <i>Mémoires</i> of the
Literary and Historical Society of Quebec also
contains a paper, evidently written in 1736, and
seemingly a report of the Intendant Hocquart
to Cardinal Fleury, the minister of Louis XV.
In the same collection is a report, <i>Considérations
sur l’état présent du Canada</i>, dated October,
1758, which could hardly have been written by
the Intendant Bigot, but is thought to have
been the writing of a Querdisien-Trémais, who
had been sent as commissioner to investigate the
finances, and who deals out equal rebuke upon
all the functionaries then in office.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

was given to “freaks of the imagination,” the

the third, which brings the story down to 1769.

French (part iii. p. 12, <i>note</i>) says: “The
two brothers met in deep mourning, and after
mutual embraces the brave D’Iberville sought
the tomb of his brother Sauvolle, where he knelt
for hours in silent grief.” All this is purely imaginary;
and in French’s second series (vol. ii.
p. 111, <i>note</i>) he concludes that Sauvolle would
appear from the text not to have been Iberville’s
brother. This doubt whether Sauvolle was a
brother of Iberville penetrates even such a work
as <i>Nos gloires nationales</i>. The author not finding
such a seigniory, says of François Le Moyne,
“We do not know if he followed his brother to
Louisiana, and is the same to whom the name
Sieur de Sauvole was given,”&mdash;all this in face
of the record in the previous paragraph of his
burial in 1687 (<i>Nos gloires</i>, i. 53). To the account
of the massacre at Natchez, in his translation of
Dumont, French appends a note (vol. v. p. 76), in
which he identifies a ship-carpenter, whose life
was spared by the Indians, as “Perricault, who,
after his escape, wrote a journal of all that
passed in Louisiana from 1700 to 1729.” Penicaut,
the spelling of whose name puzzled writers
and printers, left the colony in 1721. There was
no foundation whatever for the note.</p>

The reader might easily be misled by
the title given to the translation of a portion
of the second volume of Dumont into the belief
that the whole work was before him. There
is no mention in French of the preface, or
of the appendix to Coxe’s Carolana. Both
preface and appendix are full of interesting
material.</p>

In this translation French (iii. 83) says:
“But notwithstanding these reports, they now
create him [Bienville] brigadier-general of the
troops, and knight of the military order of St.
Louis,” etc. Compare this with the faithful
rendering of Martin (i. 229),&mdash;“The Regent ...
so far from keeping the promise he had made of
promoting him to the rank of brigadier-general,
and sending him the broad ribbon of the order
of St. Louis, would have proceeded against him
with severity if he had not been informed that
the Company’s agents in the colony had thwarted
his views.”</p>

It has all the substantial portions of the
copy given in Margry, but there are occasional
abridgments and occasional additions. The
story of the Margry relation is continuous and
uninterrupted; but in the copy given by French
items of colonial news are interspersed, and
sometimes repeated with variations. It would
seem as if the copyist had been unable properly
to separate the manuscript from that of some
other Relation of colonial affairs, and in the
exercise of his discretion had made these mistakes.
A comparison of the two accounts will
readily disclose their differences. A single
example will explain what is meant by repetitions
which may have been occasioned by confusion
of manuscripts. On p. 145 of vol. vi., or
second series vol. i. of French’s <i>Historical Collections
of Louisiana</i> occurs the following: On
the 17th of March, 1719, “the ship of war ‘Le
Comte de Toulouse’ arrived at Dauphin Island.”
On p. 146 we find, “On the 19th of April the ships
‘Maréchal de Villars,’ ‘Count de Toulouse,’ and
the ‘Phillip,’ under the command of M. de
Sérigny, the brother of M. de Bienville, arrived at
Dauphin Island.” These two paragraphs, with
their contradictory statements about the “Comte
de Toulouse,” do not occur in Margry. They are
evidently interpolated from some outside source.
Thomassy (1860) quotes <i>Annales véritables des
22 premières années de la colonisation de la Louisiane
par Pénicaut</i>, as from the “MSS. Boismare,
dans la Bibliothèque de l’État à Bâton-Rouge.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The camp-fire yarn of Jalot, with its marvellous
details about Saint-Denys’ romantic love-affair,
the gorgeous establishment of the Mexican
viceroy, and the foolhardy trip of Saint-Denys
to see his wife, are omitted in French’s translation.
They are worthless as history, but they
reveal the simplicity of Penicaut, who yielded
faith to his fellow-voyagers, in the belief that it
was his good fortune to be chosen to tell the
story to the world.</p>

Gayarré, in his preface, says: “Mr. Magne
(one of the editors of the <i>New Orleans Bee</i>)
inspected with minute care, and with a discretion
which did him honor, the portfolios of the
Minister of the Marine in France, and extracted
from them all the documents relating to Louisiana,
of which he made a judicious choice and
an exact copy. Governor Mouton, having
learned of this collection, hastened, in his position
as a clear-headed magistrate whose duty it
was to gather together what might cast light
upon the history of the country, to acquire it for
account of the State.” It is understood that
this Magne Collection was purchased for a
thousand dollars at the instance of Mr. Gayarré.
It was then deposited in the State Library; but
is no longer to be found. A similar disappearance
has happened in the case of some other
copies which were made for Mr. Edmund
Forstall, and were likewise in the State Library;
and the same fate has befallen two bound volumes
of copies which were made for the Hon.
John Perkins while in Europe, and which were
by him likewise given to the State Library.
Many of these documents were included by
Gayarré in his <i>Histoire</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It was also by the influence of Gayarré that
the Louisiana Legislature appropriated $2,000
to secure copies of papers from the Spanish
Archives. It was committed to the Hon. Romulus
Saunders of North Carolina, then the
American minister in Madrid, to propitiate the
Spanish Government in an application for permission
to make copies. He failed, though
zealous to accomplish it. Through the medium
of Prescott recourse was then had to Don Pascual
de Gayangos, who, after difficulties had
been overcome, succeeded in getting copies of a
mass of papers, which greatly aided Gayarré in
his <i>Spanish Domination</i>. These papers, like the
rest, found their way to the State Library at
Baton Rouge, but disappeared in turn during
the Civil War. A small part of them was discovered
by Mr. Lyman Draper, of Wisconsin, in
the keeping of the widow of a Federal officer,
and through Mr. Draper’s instrumentality was
restored to the Library. The correspondence of
Messrs. Saunders, Gayangos, and Gayarré makes
one of the State documents of Louisiana.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A few years since, another movement was
made by Mr. Gayarré to get other papers from
Spain, impelled to it by information of large
diaries (said to be four hundred and fifty-two
large bundles) still unexamined in the Spanish
Archives, pertaining to Louisiana. The State
of Louisiana was not in a condition to incur
any outlay; and by motion of General Gibson
a Bill was introduced into the National House
of Representatives, appropriating $5,000 to procure
from England, France, and Spain copies
of documents relating to Florida and Louisiana.
Nothing seems to have come of the
effort beyond the printing of a letter of Mr.
Gayarré, with his correspondence with Saunders
and Gayangos, which was done by order of a
committee to whom the subject was referred.
The facts of this note are derived from a statement
kindly furnished by Mr. Gayarré.</p>

“We in France must obey the King’s command.”</p>

Referring to the maps (1756), Smith, the New York historian (<i>Hist. N. York</i>, Albany, 1814, p. 218), says:
“Dr. Mitchell’s is the only authentic one extant. None of the rest concerning America have passed under

This innocent attempt to correct the floating
rumors gave offence to the magistrates, as a
license that should be resisted, or much worse
might happen. Sewall refers to it as giving
“much distaste, because not licensed, and because
of passage referring to the French king
and Maquas.” On the 1st of October the governor
and council “disallowed” it. Mather
attacked its impudence in a sharp letter the next
day; and the little over-ambitious chronicle
never came to a second issue. (Sewall’s <i>Diary</i>,
i. 332.)</p>

See Vol. IV. p. 357; and for sources, p. 361.
Sewall, under date of December 29, 1690 (<i>Letter
book</i>, p. 115), writes, “I have discoursed with all
sorts, and find that neither activity nor courage
were wanting in him [Phips], and the form of
the attack was agreed on by the Council of
War.” A significant utterance of Frontenac is
instanced in the same letter: “When the French
injuries were objected to Count Frontenack by
ours at Canada, his answer was that we were all
one people; so if Albany or Hartford provoke
them, they hold it just to fall on Massachusetts,
Plimouth, Rode Island, or any other English
plantation. In time of distress the Massachusetts
are chiefly depended on for help;” and Sewall
urges Mather to procure the sending of three
frigates,&mdash;one to be stationed in the Vineyard
Sound, another at Nantasket, and a third at
Portsmouth.</p>

by Benj. Harris, 1692. It was reprinted by
Neal in his <i>New England</i>, 2d ed. ii. App., and
is included in various editions of the <i>Charter

is at the State House, and a heliotype of
its appearance, as it hangs in a glass case on the
walls of the Secretary’s office, is given in the

Haliburton (<i>Rule and Misrule of the English
in America</i>, 232) praises him, and calls
him “a true specimen of a great liberal governor.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Cf. Frederic de Peyster’s <i>Life and Administration
of Richard, Earl of Bellomont, governor
of the provinces of N. Y., Mass., and N. H.,
from 1697 to 1701</i>. N. Y.: 1879,&mdash;an address
delivered before the N. Y. Hist. Society.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bellomont, in his speech to the General
Court, advised them to succor the Huguenot
clergyman of Boston, his congregation being reduced
in numbers. It was five years before that
(1695) the Huguenot Oxford settlement had
been broken up by the Indian depredations, and
nine years earlier (1686) they had first come to
Massachusetts with their minister. We have
lately had an adequate account of their story
in Charles W. Baird’s <i>Huguenot Emigration to
America</i> (N. Y., 1885, two vols.), and the “Huguenot
Society of America” was established in
1884, when the first part of their <i>Proceedings</i>
was published. The earliest treatment of the
subject is Dr. Abiel Holmes’s <i>Memoir of the
French Protestants</i>, published in the <i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Collections</i> (vol. xxii. p. 1). This was
largely about the Oxford settlement, which has
since been further illustrated by Geo. T. Daniels
in his <i>Huguenots in the Nipmuck Country</i>.
Next after Holmes came Hannah F. Lee’s
<i>Huguenots in France and America</i> (Cambridge,
1843), but it is scant in matter. Somewhat
later (1858, etc.), Mr. Joseph Willard considered
them in his paper, “Naturalization in the
American Colonies,” printed in the <i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i> (iv. 337), showing they were not naturalized
till 1731; and Lucius Manlius Sargent
recalled many associations with their names in
his <i>Dealings with the Dead</i> (vol. ii. pp. 495-549).
Cf. further, Ira M. Barton, in <i>Am. Antiq. Soc.
Proc.</i>, Ap., 1862, Ap., 1864; <i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>
(chap. by C. C. Smith), ii. p. 249; Blaikie’s
<i>Presbyterianism in New England</i> (Boston, 1881),
where their church is considered the forerunner
of the Presbyterian method of government; Palfrey’s
<i>New England</i>, iv. p. 185. The Huguenot
society recognizes by their vice-presidents two
other settlements of the Huguenots before 1787,
in New England, beside those of Oxford and
Boston, namely, one in Maine and another in
Rhode Island,&mdash;the latter being commemorated
by Elisha R. Potter’s <i>French Settlements
in Rhode Island</i>, being no. 5 of the <i>Rhode Island
Historical Tracts</i>, published by S. S. Rider in
Providence, R. I.</p>

Dr. Palfrey amply illustrates the reciprocal
influence of the old and new politics. Cf. Dr.
Ellis in <i>Sewall Papers</i>, iii. 46. There is no more
pointed evidence, however, of the scant interest
taken by the wits of London in the current
politics and customs of the American colonies
than the fact that among the multitudinous pictorial
satires of the period, preserved in the
British Museum and noted in its <i>Catal. of prints,
Satires</i> (ii., iii., and iv., 1689-1763), there is
scarce a single purely American subject. One
or two about the confronting of the English and
French in the Ohio valley, and incidentally
touching English successes in American waters,
are the only ones noted in a somewhat careful
examination. <i>Catal. of prints in the Brit. Mus.

Cotton Mather would have it that the governor

had expounded for the first time the restrictive
system in his <i>New Discourse of Trade</i>, which
was not, however, published in London till 1694,
but was various times reprinted later. He called
New England “the most prejudicial plantation
to the kingdom of England,” inhabited as it
was “by a sort of people called puritans.” Cf.
John Adams’ <i>Works</i>, x. 328, 330, 332; Scott,

in his speech on the Writs of Assistance cites
Child, as well as Joshua Gee’s <i>Trade and Navigation
of Great Britain Considered</i> (London,
1729), which was the first to make evident the
policy of making the colonies subserve the public
revenue, as they already under the navigation
acts bettered the private trade of the mother
country. This book was reprinted at London
in 1730, 1738, and at Glasgow in 1735, 1760, and
in “a new edition, with many interesting notes
and additions by a merchant,” in 1767. Cf. John

The Boston ministers, Mather, Wadsworth,
and Colman, issued a flying sheet in 1719, <i>A
Testimony against Evil Customs</i>, in which they regretted
that ordinations, weddings, trainings, and
huskings were made the occasion of unseemly
merriment, and that lectures were not more generally
attended. (Harv. Coll. lib., 10396.92.)
Lodge (<i>Short Hist. Eng. Colonies</i>, 463) indicates

This was published in London and Boston,

300. Tyler (<i>Am. Lit.</i>, ii. 119) is in error in
placing its publication in 1728. The tract has
been greatly praised. James Otis referred to it
with commendation in his great Writs-of-Assistance
speech. John Adams (<i>Works</i>, x. 343) calls
it “one of our most classical American productions.”
Tudor (<i>Life of Otis</i>, ch. vi.) thinks that
in point of style it vies with any writing before
the Revolution. Grahame (iii. 72) says it has a
great deal of interesting information and ingenious
argument. Bancroft (revised ed., ii. 247)
gives it credit for influence, and makes a synopsis.</p>

Cf. annexed extract from Popple’s <i>British

are the chief ones, immediately antecedent to
Popple’s. One of Moll’s, called “New England,
New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,” is in
Oldmixon’s <i>Brit. Empire in America</i>, 1708. In
1729 he included what he called a “Map of New
England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania”
in his <i>New Survey of the Globe</i>. It singularly
enough omits the Kennebec and Penobscot
rivers. A somewhat amusing transformation of
names is found in a map published by Homann,
at Nuremberg, <i>Nova Anglia Anglorum Coloniis
florentissima</i>. David Humphrey’s <i>Hist. Acc. of
the Society for the propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts</i> has also a “Map of New England,

marked to which missionaries had been sent.
It is dated 1730.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Douglass in 1729, referring to maps of New
England, wrote, “There is not one extant but

The expostulatory and polemical literature
of the “Great Awakening in New England” is
abundantly set forth in Haven’s list appended to
the Antiq. Soc. ed. of Thomas’s <i>History of Printing</i>,
vol. ii., and in the <i>Collections towards a bibliog.
of Congregationalism</i>, appended by Dr. H.
M. Dexter to his <i>Congregationalism as seen in its
Literature</i>, to be found in chronological order in
both places between 1736 and 1750; and in the
<i>Prince Catalogue</i>, p. 65. Thomas Prince supported,
and his son published, during the excitement,
a periodical called <i>The Christian History,
containing accounts of the revival and propagation
of religion in Great Britain, America, etc.</i> (March
5, 1743, to February 23, 1744-5, in 104 numbers).
Cf. Thomas, <i>Hist. Printing</i>, Am. Antiq. Soc. ed.,
ii. 66. A letter of Chas. Chauncy to Mr. George
Wishart, concerning the state of religion in
New England (1742), is printed in the <i>Clarendon
Hist. Soc. Reprints</i>, no. 7 (1883). Chauncy’s
<i>Seasonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in
New England</i>, Boston, 1743, is the main expression
of his position in the controversy, followed
up by a <i>Letter to the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield</i>,
(Boston, 1743), in vindication of passages in the
<i>Seasonable Thoughts</i> which Whitefield had controverted.
(Carter-Brown, iii. no. 813, for this and
other tracts of that year.) Whitefield’s journals
were frequently issued (Carter-Brown, iii. nos.
631-34, 669-70), and the most comprehensive of
the modern Lives of Whitefield is that by Tyerman
(London, 1876). <i>Poole’s Index</i> (p. 1406)
gives the clues to the mass of periodical literature
on Whitefield. Cf. Tracy’s <i>Great Awakening</i>
(1842). In Connecticut the controversy between
the New Lights (revivalists) and the
Old Lights took on a more virulent form than
in Massachusetts. (Cf. Trumbull, Hollister,
etc.) About the best of the condensed narratives
of the “Great Awakening” is that of Dr.
Palfrey in his <i>Compendious Hist. of New England</i>,
iv. ch. 7 and 8, the latter chapter outlining
the course of the commotion in Connecticut.</p>

find Le Loutre and his Indians besieging the
town. The enemy withdrew; Tyng threw men

ammunition, and other things necessary for
the support of the garrison at Louisbourg. If

War was burdensome; but it had some relief.
A Boston ship belonging to Josiah Quincy
had, by exposing hats and coats on handspikes
above her rail, allured a heavier Spanish ship
into a surrender; and when the lucky deceiver
brought her prize into Boston, the boxes of gold
and silver which were carted through the streets
required an armed guard for their protection.
Other profits were less creditable. Governor
Cornwallis writes from Halifax (November 27,
1750) to the Lords of Trade: “Some gentlemen
of Boston who have long served the government,
[and] because they have not the supplying of
everything, have done all the mischief they could.
Their substance, which they have got from the
public, enables them to distress and domineer.
Without them they say we can’t do, and so must
comply with what terms they think proper to
impose. These are Messrs. Apthorp and Hancock,
the two richest merchants in Boston,&mdash;made
so by the public money, and now wanton
in their insolent demands.” Akins’ <i>Pub. Doc. of
Nova Scotia</i>, 630. Thomas Hancock’s letter book
(April, 1745-June, 1750), embracing many letters
to Kilby, in London, is now in the Mass.

What seem to be the best figures to be
reached regarding the population of the English
colonies at the opening of the war would place
the total at something over a million. This
sum is reached thus: In 1749 Maryland had
100,000. In 1752, Georgia had 3,000, and South
Carolina 25,000. In 1754, Nova Scotia had 4,000.
In 1755, North Carolina had 50,000; Virginia,
125,000; New Jersey, 75,000; New Hampshire,
75,000. Estimates must be made for the others:
Pennsylvania, 220,000 (including 100,000 German
and other foreign immigrants); Connecticut,
100,000; Rhode Island, 30,000; New York,
55,000, and Massachusetts, 200,000. This foots
up 1,062,000.</p>

While they were watching at Boston every
tidings of the war from the east and from the
west, the gossips were weaving about the trial
of Phillis and Mark for the poisoning of their
master all the suspicions which unsettle the
sense of social security; and when in September
the common law of England asserted its dominance,
the man was hanged, while the woman
was burned, the last instance in our criminal
history of this dread penalty for petit treason was
recorded. Cf. A. C. Goodell, Jr., in <i>Proceedings
Mass. Hist. Soc.</i> (March, 1883), and in a separate
enlarged issue of the same paper. It is well
not to forget that while in old England at this
time there were 160 capital offences, there were
less than one tenth as many in Massachusetts.
These are enumerated by H. B. Staples in his
paper on the <i>Province Laws</i> (1884), p. 10.</p>

It is not unlikely that enlistments were impeded
by a breach of faith with the New England
troops, for they had been detained at the
eastward beyond their term of enlistment. Shirley
remonstrated about it to Gov. Lawrence,
of Nova Scotia. Cf. Akins’ <i>Pub. Doc. of Nov.

“The New England colonies take the lead in all
military matters.... In these governments lies

“I am here,” writes Pownall, September 6,
1757, “at the head of what is called a rich, flourishing,
powerful, enterprising colony,&mdash;’t is all
puff, ’t is all false; they are ruined and undone
in their circumstances.” (<i>Pownall’s Letter Book.</i>)

10,000 of the seamen in the British navy in 1756
were of American birth. “From the year 1754
to 1762, there were raised by Massachusetts,
35,000 men; and for three years successively
7,000 men each year.... An army of seven
thousand, compared with the population of
Massachusetts in the middle of the last century,
is considerably greater than an army of one million
for France in the time of Napoleon.” Edw.

Vol. III. p. 345. Sibley’s <i>Harvard Graduates</i>,
iii. 79. Typographical errors in the book
are very numerous, as Mather did not have a
chance to correct the type. A page of “errata”
was printed, but is found in few copies.
Some copies have been completed by a fac-simile
of the page, which Mr. Charles Deane has
caused to be made. Some copies of the book
exist on large paper. (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, ii. 123; <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, ii. 37.) The Hartford ed. of
1820 was printed from a copy without this list of
errata, and so preserves the original crop of errors.
So did the edition of 1853; but the sheets
of this, with a memoir by S. G. Drake added,
were furnished with a new title in 1855, in which
it is professed that the errors have been corrected;
but the profession is said not to be true.
(<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 29.) An exceptionally fine copy
of the original edition, well bound, will bring $40
to $50. Holmes (<i>Amer. Annals</i>, 2d ed., i. 544)

The suppression, however, was incomplete.
The numbers already out could not be recalled,
and it is these bound up which constitute volume

in which the suppression is promised is
often bound with them. Rich (<i>Catal.</i>, 1832, p.

note Boston editions in 1755. In the
last year (1755) and in 1760 the book was reprinted
in London, with a map; but Rich and
the Carter-Brown catalogue seem to err in saying
that the 1760 edition was one with a new
title merely. Sabin (vol. v. 20,727-28) says the
edition of 1760 has a few alterations and corrections.</p>

of this country as it is generally read and popularly
understood.... Schools made New Englanders
a reading and writing people, and no
subject was more palatable than themselves....
The consequence is that the works on New England
history exceed those of all other parts of
the country.... The general histories of the
United States, like those of Bancroft and Hildreth,
are written from the New England point
of view, and Palfrey embodies in an especial
manner the whole genius and development of
their distinctive autonomy, with all the extenuating
circumstances, the deprecating apologies,
the clever and artistic arrangement in the background,
of all that might offend the present
taste.”</p>

<i>Report</i>, etc., p. 24. Beside the “Mather Papers,” which refer to the colonial period, the <i>Prince Catalogue</i>
shows the “Cotton and Prince Papers” (p. 153) and the “Hinckley Papers” (p. 154), which extend
beyond the colonial into the provincial period. Gov. Belcher’s letter-books are preserved in the cabinet of
the Mass. Hist. Soc. Vol. i. begins with Sept., 1731, and his connection with Boston ceases in vol. v., where
also his letters from New Jersey begin and are continued to Dec., 1755. (Cf. <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, ii. 60.) Dr.
Belknap (<i>Papers</i>, ii. 169) speaks of them as having been sold “at Russell’s vendue for waste paper; some of
them were torn up.” Various letters of Belcher are printed in the <i>N. H. Provincial Papers</i>, iv. 866-880.
The list of MSS. in the cabinet of the Mass. Historical Society (<i>Proc.</i>, x., April, 1868) gives various ones of

The first and second editions are extremely rare. (Brinley, i. 818, 1392.) A third edition was printed in
London, coming down to 1719, for the Lords of Trade, the charter being dated 1721 and the laws 1724. Other
editions were printed in Boston in Jan., 1726-27 (Brinley, i. 1,394); 1742 (Ibid. i. 1,398); 1755 (Temporary
Laws); 1759-61 (Perpetual Laws); 1763 (Temporary Laws). These had supplements in needful cases as the
years went on. Such of the Province Laws as remained in force after the province became a State were
printed as an appendix to the State Laws in 1801, 1807, 1814. (Ames and Goodell’s edition, preface.)</p>

A summary of the work done by the Commissioner on the Province Laws is set forth in D. T. V. Huntoon’s
<i>Province Laws, their value and the progress of the new edition</i>, Boston, 1885 (pp. 24), which also contains
a history of the various editions. From this tract it appears that Massachusetts, for what printing of
her early records she has so far done, for historical uses solely, has expended as follows:&mdash;</p>

Vols. xlv., xlvi., and xlvii. (1878, 1879, 1882). They are richly annotated with notes under the supervision
of Dr. Ellis, as chairman of the committee of publication, who was assisted by Professor H. W. Torrey and
Mr. Wm. H. Whitmore, the latter being responsible for the topographical and genealogical notes, of which
there is great store. Dr. Ellis communicated to the society in 1873 (<i>Proc.</i>, xii. 358) various extracts from
the letter-book, which accompanied the diary when it was transferred to the society; but these with other
letters and papers will be included in a fourth and fifth volume of the <i>Sewall Papers</i>, now in press.</p>

Probably no personal record of the provincial period of New England history has excited so much interest
as the publication of Sewall’s diary. The judgments on it have been kindly, with few exceptions. Cf. D.
A. Goddard, <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, ii. 417; Sibley’s <i>Harvard Graduates</i>, ii. 345, 364; H. C. Lodge, <i>Short
Hist. of the Eng. Colonies</i>, 426; <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, ii. 641; Poole, <i>Index to Period. lit.</i>, p. 1181.
Tyler (<i>Hist. Amer. lit.</i>, ii. 99) gives a generous estimate of Sewall’s character, written before the publication
of his diary. Palfrey in his vol. iv. made use of the diary after it came into the society’s library. (<i>Proc.</i>,
xviii. 378.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are genealogical records of the Sewalls in <i>Family Memorials, a series of genealogical and biographical
monographs on the families of Salisbury, Aldworth-Elbridge, Sewall, etc. ... by Edward Elbridge
Salisbury, privately printed</i>, 1885, two folio volumes. Cf. also volume i. of <i>Sewall Papers</i>.</p>

Particularly vol. ii. ch. 16, “Life in Boston in the Provincial Period.” In the same work other aspects of
social and intellectual life are studied in Dr. Mackenzie’s chapter on the religious life (in vol. ii,), in Mr. D. A.
Goddard’s on the literary life (in vol. ii.), and in Mr. Geo. S. Hale’s on the philanthrophic tendency (in vol.
iv.). Incidental glimpses of the ways of living are presented in several of Mr. Samuel A. Drake’s books, like
<i>The Old Landmarks of Boston</i>, <i>Old Landmarks of Middlesex</i>, and <i>Nooks and Corners of the New England
Coast</i>. The coast life is depicted in such local histories as Babson’s <i>Gloucester</i>, and Freeman’s <i>Cape
Cod</i>. The colonial house and household, beside being largely illustrated in the papers of Dr. Eggleston already
mentioned, are discussed in Mr. C. A. Cummings’ chapter on “Architecture,” and Mr. E. L. Bynner’s chapter
on “Landmarks” in the <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>. Cf. also Lodge, pp. 446, 458; and “Old Colonial houses
<i>versus</i> old English houses,” by R. Jackson, in <i>Amer. Architect</i>, xvii. 3. Copley’s pictures and the description
of them in A. T. Perkins’s <i>Life and Works of John Singleton Copley</i> (privately printed, 1873), with such
surveys as are given in the Eggleston papers in <i>The Century</i>, present to us the outer appearance of the governing
classes of that day.</p>

For the town system of New England and its working, compare references in Lodge (p. 414), <i>Mem. Hist.
Boston</i>, i. 454, and W. E. Foster’s <i>Reference lists</i>, July, 1882: to which may be added Herbert B. Adams’s
<i>Germanic Origin of the New England Towns</i> (1882), and Edward Channing’s <i>Town and County government
in the English colonies of North America</i> (1884),&mdash;both published in the “Johns Hopkins University
studies;” Judge P. E. Aldrich in <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1884; “Town Meeting,” by John Fiske,
in <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, Jan., 1885 (also in his <i>American Political Ideas</i>, N. Y., 1885); Scott’s <i>Development
of Constitutional Liberty</i>, p. 174; Fisher’s <i>American Political Ideas</i>, ch. i. (1885).</p>
<p class="pfc4">For the characteristics of its religious congregations the reader may consult Felt’s <i>Ecclesiastical History of
New England</i>; the “Ecclesiastical Hist. of Mass. and Plymouth Colonies,” in <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vols. vii.,
viii., ix., etc.; Lodge’s <i>English Colonies</i> (pp. 423-434); the chapters by Dr. Mackenzie in vol. ii., and those on
the various denominations in vol. iii., of the <i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, with their references; William Stevens
Perry’s <i>Hist. of the American Episcopal Church</i> (2 vols. 1885); H. W. Foote’s <i>King’s Chapel</i> (Boston);
M. C. Tyler’s <i>Hist. of American Literature</i>; H. M. Dexter’s <i>Congregationalism as seen in its literature</i>
(particularly helpful is its appended bibliography); Dr. W. B. Sprague’s <i>Annals of the American Pulpit</i>;
with the notices of such as were ministers in Sibley’s <i>Harvard Graduates</i>; the lives of preachers like Jonathan
Edwards; and among the general histories of New England, particularly that of Backus.</p>
<p class="pfc4">One encounters in studying the ecclesiastical history of New England frequent references to organizations
for propagating the gospel, and their similarity of names confuses the reader’s mind. They can, however, be
kept distinct, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">I. “Corporation for promoting and propagating the gospel among the Indians of New England.” Incorporated
July 27, 1649. Dissolved 1661. There is a history of it by Scull in the <i>New Eng. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i>, xxxvi. 157. What are known as the “Eliot tracts” were its publications. (Cf. Vol. III.
p. 355.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">II. “Corporation for the propagation of the gospel in New England and parts adjacent in America.”
Incorporated April 7, 1662. It still exists. The history of it is given by W. M. Venning in the <i>Roy. Hist.
Soc. Trans.</i>, 2d ser., ii. 293. Its work in New England was broken up by the American Revolution, but it
later (1786) began anew its labors in New Brunswick. Cf. also Henry William Busk’s <i>Sketch of the Origin
and the Recent History of the New England Company</i>, London, 1884.</p>

What has been called “the first gun fired in the Land-bank war of 1714-1721” was a reprint in Boston, in
1714, of a tract which was originally published in London in 1688, called <i>A Model for erecting a Bank of
Credit. Adapted especially for his majesties Plantations in America.</i> (<i>Prince Catal.</i>, p. 45.) The Boston
preface, dated Feb. 26, 1713-14, says that “a scheme of a bank of credit, founded upon a land security,
... will be humbly offered to the consideration of the General Assembly at their next session.” (Sabin, no.
49,795; Brinley, i. no. 1,430.)</p>

In a tract, <i>Money the Sinews of Trade</i>, Boston, 1731 (Brinley, i. no. 1,447), there is a wail over the disastrous
effect of Rhode Island bills in Massachusetts. Rhode Island, in 1733, issued a large amount of paper
money for circulation, chiefly in Massachusetts; and the elder colony suffered from the infliction in spite of all
she could do. There is in the <i>Connecticut Col. Records</i>, 1726-35, p. 421, a fac-simile of a three-shilling bill
of the “New London Society united for trade and commerce in New England.”</p>

It was reprinted in Boston in 1740; again in London, 1751, with a postscript; and once more, London,
1757. Sabin, v. no. 20,721; Carter-Brown, iii. 608, 660; Brinley, i. no. 1,450; Harvard Col. lib’y, 10352.3. Douglass
reiterated his views with not a little feeling in various notes, sometimes uncalled for, through his <i>Summary</i>,
etc., in 1747. Two rejoinders to Douglass’s views appeared, entitled as follows: <i>An inquiry into the
nature and uses of money, more especially of the bills of public credit, old tenor.... To which is added a
Reply to a former Essay on Silver and Paper Currencies</i>. <i>As also a Postscript containing remarks on a

<p class="pfc4">Other tracts in the controversy were these: <i>A letter to &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, a merchant in London concerning

(iv. 547), Williamson (ii. 203), Barry (ii. 132), take but a broad view of the subject. Hutchinson (ii. 352)
is an authoritative guide, and W. G. Sumner in his <i>Hist. of Amer. Currency</i>, and J. J. Knox in <i>U. S. Notes</i>
(1884), have summarized the matter. Cf. a paper on the Land-bank and Silver Scheme read before the
Amer. Statistical Association in 1874 by E. H. Derby; and one by Francis Brinley in the <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i>,
Sept. 4, 1856. There is a fac-simile of a Mass. three-shillings bill of 1741 and a sixpence of 1744 in

In 1749 Douglass said (<i>Summary</i>, i. 535), “The parties in Massachusetts Bay at present are not the
Loyal and Jacobite, the Governor and Country, Whig and Tory, but the debtors and creditors. The debtor
side has had the ascendant ever since 1741, to the almost utter ruin of the country.”</p>

The act is printed and a description of the stamps is given in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Gen. Reg.</i>, July, 1860, p.
267. One of the stamps shows a schooner, another a cod-fish, and a third a pine-tree,&mdash;all proper emblems of
Massachusetts. The vessel with a schooner rig was a Massachusetts invention, being devised at Gloucester
in 1714, and the story goes that her name came from some one exclaiming, “How she schoons!” as she was
launched from the ways. Cf. Babson’s <i>Gloucester,</i> p. 251; <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Nov., 1884, p. 474, and
(by Admiral Preble), Feb., 1885, p. 207; and <i>United Service</i> (also by Preble), Jan., 1884, p. 101. The
earliest mention of the fish as an emblem I find in Parkman’s statement (<i>Frontenac</i>, p. 199, referring to Colden’s
<i>Five Nations</i>) that one was sent to the Iroquois in 1690 as a token of alliance. A figure of a cod now
hangs in the chamber of the Mass. House of Representatives, and the legislative records first note it in 1784,
but lead one to infer that it had been used earlier. Cf. <i>Essex Inst. Hist. Coll.</i>, Sept., 1866; <i>Hist. Mag.</i>,
x. 197. The pine-tree appeared on the coined shilling piece in 1652, which is known by its name. Cf. <i>Hist.

Documentary sources respecting this prolonged controversy will be found in William Slade, Jr.’s <i>Vermont
State Papers, being a collection of records and documents connected with the assumption and establishment
of government by the people of Vermont</i> (Middlebury, 1823); in <i>Documents and Records relating
to New Hampshire</i>, vol. x.; in O’Callaghan’s <i>Doc. Hist. New York</i>, vol. iv. pp. 329-625, with a map; in the
<i>Fund Publications</i> of the N. Y. Hist. Society, vol. iii., and in the <i>Historical Magazine</i> (1873-74), vol. xxi.
Henry Stevens, in the preface (p. vii.) of his <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i> (1870), refers to a collection of papers
formed by his father, Henry Stevens, senior, of Barnet, Vermont. The first volume of the <i>Collections of the
Vermont Hist. Soc.</i> had other papers, the editing of which was sharply criticised by H. B. Dawson in the
<i>Historical Magazine</i>, Jan., 1871; with a reply by Hiland Hall in the July number (p. 49). The controversy
was continued in the volume for 1872, Mr. Hall issuing fly leaves of argument and remonstrance to the
editor’s statements.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The earliest general survey of the subject, after the difficulties were over, is in Ira Allen’s <i>Natural and
political History of the State of Vermont</i> (London, 1798, with a map), which is reprinted in the first volume
of the <i>Collections of the Vermont Hist. Soc.</i> (Montpelier, 1870). It is claimed to be “the aim of the
writer to lay open the source of contention between Vermont and New York, and the reasons which induced
the former to repudiate both the jurisdiction and claims of the latter, before and during the American Revolution,
and also to point out the embarrassments the people met with in founding and establishing the
independence of the State against the intrigues and claims of New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.”
The most extensive of the later accounts is in Hiland Hall’s <i>Early Hist. of Vermont</i> (1868), ch. v.
and vi., with a part of Mitchell’s map of 1755. Smith’s <i>History of New York</i> (ii. 149) gives the New York
side of the controversy. Cf. also Bancroft’s <i>United States</i>, final revision, ii. 361; and Philip H. Smith’s
<i>Green-Mountain Boys, or Vermont and the New York land jobbers</i> (Pawling, N. Y., 1885).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The controversy enters more or less into local histories, like Holden’s <i>Queensbury, N. Y.</i> (p. 393); William
Bassett’s <i>Richmond, N. H.</i> (ch. iii.); O. E. Randall’s <i>Chesterfield, N. H.</i>; Saunderson’s <i>Charlestown, N. H.</i>
All the towns constituting these early grants are included in Abby Maria Hemenway’s <i>Vermont Historical
Gazetteer, a local history of all the towns in the State</i> (Burlington and Montpelier, 1867-1882), in four
volumes.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The bibliography of Vermont to 1860, showing 250 titles, was printed by B. H. Hall in <i>Norton’s Lit. Register</i>,
vol. vi.; a more extended list of 6,000 titles by Marcus D. Gilman was printed in the <i>Argus and Patriot</i>,
of Montpelier, Jan., 1879, to Sept. 15, 1880. (Boston Public Library. 6170.14.)</p>

Cf. documents mentioned in Henry Stevens’s <i>Catal. of books and pamphlets relating to New Hampshire</i>
(1885, p. 15), which documents were sold by him to the State of New Hampshire. Stevens says regarding
these papers: “Dear fussy old Richard Hakluyt, the most learned geographer of his age, but with certain
crude and warped notions of the South Sea ‘down the back side of Florida,’ which became worked into many
of King James’s and King Charles’s charters, and the many grants that grew out of them, was the unconscious
parent of many geographical puzzles.... All these are fully illustrated in the numerous papers cited in these
cases.” The Thomlinson correspondence (1733-37) in the Belknap papers (Mass. Hist. Soc.), which is printed
in the <i>N. H. Prov. Papers</i>, iv. 833, etc., relates to the bounds with Massachusetts, and chiefly consists of letters
which passed between Theodore Atkinson, of Portsmouth, and Capt. John Thomlinson, the province agent
in London. Cf. Hiland Hall’s <i>Vermont</i>, ch. iv.; Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>, iv. 554; Belknap, Farmer’s ed.,
p. 219; and the Report of the Committee on the name Kearsarge, in the <i>N. H. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1876-84,

The original edition is called <i>The Redeemed Captive, returning to Zion</i>. <i>A faithful history of remarkable
occurrences in the captivity and deliverance of Mr. John Williams, minister of the gospel in Deerfield,
who, in the desolation which befel that plantation, by an incursion of the French and Indians, was by
them carried away with his family into Canada,</i> [with] <i>a sermon preached by him on his return at Boston,
Dec. 5, 1706</i>. Boston, 1707. (Harv. Col. lib., 4375.12; Brinley, i. no. 494; Carter-Brown, iii. no. 103.)
A second edition was issued at Boston in 1720; a third in 1738, with an appendix of details by Stephen
Williams and Thomas Prince; a fourth without date [1773]; a fifth in 1774; another at New London without
date [1780?]; one at Greenfield in 1793, with an additional appendix by John Taylor,&mdash;the same who delivered
a <i>Century Sermon</i> in Deerfield, Feb. 29, 1804, printed at Greenfield the same year; what was called
a fifth edition at Boston in 1795; sixth at Greenfield, with additions, in 1800; again at New Haven in 1802,
following apparently the fifth edition, and containing Taylor’s appendix. United with the narrative of Mrs.
Rowlandson’s captivity, it made part of a volume issued at Brookfield in 1811, as <i>Captivity and Deliverance
of Mr. John Williams and of Mrs. Rowlandson, written by themselves</i>. The latest edition is one published
at Northampton in 1853, to which is added a biographical memoir [of John Williams] with appendix
and notes by Stephen W. Williams. (Brinley, i. nos. 495-505; Cooke, 2,735-37; Field, <i>Indian Bibliog., 1672-75</i>.)
The memoir thus mentioned appeared originally as <i>A Biographical Memoir of the Rev. John Williams,
first minister of Deerfield, with papers relating to the early Indian wars in Deerfield</i>, Greenfield, 1837. The
author, Stephen W. Williams, was a son of the captive, and he gives more details of the attack and massacre
than his father did. Jeremiah Colburn (<i>Bibliog. of Mass.</i>) notes an edition dated 1845. This book has an
appendix presenting the names of the slain and captured, and Captain Stoddard’s journal of a scout from
Deerfield to Onion or French River in 1707. (Field, no. 1,674.) John Williams died in 1729, and a notice of
him from the <i>N. E. Weekly Journal</i> is copied in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, April, 1854, p. 174; and
Isaac Chauncey’s <i>Sermon</i> at his funeral was printed in Boston in 1729. (Brinley, no. 508.) The house in
Deerfield in which Williams lived, showing the marks of the tomahawk which beat in the door, stood till near
the middle of this century. An unsuccessful effort was made in 1847 to prevent its destruction. (<i>N. E.
Hist. and Gen. Reg.</i>, ii. 110.) There are views of it in Hoyt’s <i>Antiquarian Researches</i>, and in Gay’s <i>Pop.
Hist. United States</i>, iii. 122. Eleazer Williams, the missionary to the Indians at the west, was supposed to be
a great grandson of the captive, through Eunice Williams, one of the captive’s daughters, who adopted the
Indian life during her detention in Canada, and married, refusing afterwards to return to her kindred. A
claim was set up late in Eleazer Williams’ life that the was the lost dauphin, Louis XVII., and he is said to
have told stories to confirm it, some of which gave him a name for questionable veracity. In 1853, a paper in
<i>Putnam’s Magazine</i> (vol. i. 194), called “Have we a Bourbon among us?” followed by a longer presentation
of the claim by the same writer, the Rev. J. H. Hanson, in a book, <i>The Lost Prince</i>, attracted much attention
to Williams, who died a few years later in 1858, aged about 73. There is a memoir of Mr. Williams
in vol. iii. of the <i>Memorial Biographies</i> of the N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Society. The question of his descent
produced a number of magazine articles (cf. <i>Poole’s Index</i>, p. 1411, and appendix to the <i>Longmeadow Centennial
Celebration</i>), the outcome of which was not favorable to Williams’ pretension, whose truthfulness in
other matters has been seriously questioned. Hoyt, the author of the <i>Antiquarian Researches</i>, represented
on the authority of Williams that there were documents in the convents of Canada showing that the French,
in their attack on Deerfield, had secured and had taken to Canada a bell which hung in the belfry of the
Deerfield meeting-house, and that this identical bell was placed upon the chapel of St. Regis. Benjamin F.
De Costa (<i>Galaxy</i>, Jan., 1870, vol. ix. 124) and others have showed that the St. Regis settlement did not
exist till long after. This turned the allegation into an attempt to prove that the place of the bell was St.
Louis instead, the present Caughnawaga. Geo. T. Davis, who examines this story, and gives some additional
details about the attack on the town, has reached the conclusion, in his “Bell of St. Regis,” that Williams
deceived Hoyt by a fabrication. (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> (1870), xi. 311; Hough’s <i>St. Lawrence and Franklin
Counties</i>, ch. 2.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, ix. 478 (March, 1867), a contemporary account of the destruction
of Deerfield, with a table of losses in persons and property; and a letter by John Schuyler in the <i>Mass.

The fort will be seen to consist of a house (A in ground plan, 40 × 24), nine-feet walls of four-inch white
ash plank, surmounted by a gambrel roof, the pitches of which are seen (E, F) in the profile, while the limits
of the house are marked (X X) in the prospect. Sills (H) on the ground gave support to pillars (I, K, in
ground plan, A, C, in profile), which held a platform (B in profile) which was reached by doors (K in profile),
and protected towards the enemy by a bulwark of plank pierced with loop-holes, as the doors and window-shields
of the house were. One corner of this surrounding breastwork had a tower for lookout, as seen in the
prospect. At one end a wall (E, F, G, in ground plan) with a bastion (D) enclosed a yard (L in ground plan,
G in profile), which was planked over. In this was a well (C in ground plan) and a storehouse (B, size
35 × 10, in ground plan), with a roof inclining inward (H, in profile).</p>

Hall’s <i>Eastern Vermont</i>, i. 67. The papers of Col. Williams are preserved in two volumes in the cabinet
of the Mass. Hist. Soc., having come into their possession in 1837. (<i>Proceedings</i>, ii. 95, 121.) The papers are
few before 1744, and the first volume comes down to 1757, and concerns the warfare with the French and Indians
in the western part of the province. The second volume ends in the main with 1774, though there are
a few later papers, and continues the subject of the first, as well as grouping the papers relating to Williams
College and Williams’ correspondence with Gov. Hutchinson. It was this same Col. Israel Williams who
took offence in 1762 that his son’s name was put too low in the social scale, as marked on the class-lists of
Harvard, and tried to induce the governor to charter a new college in Hampshire County. (<i>Proc. Mass. Hist.
Soc.</i>, xx. 46.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">The MS. index to the <i>Mass. Archives</i> will reveal much in those papers illustrative of this treacherous warfare,
and the <i>Report of the Commissioners on the Records, etc.</i> (1885), shows (p. 24) that there is a considerable
mass of uncalendared papers of the same character. Various letters from Gov. Shirley and others addressed
to Col. John Stoddard during 1745-47, respecting service on the western frontiers of Massachusetts,
are preserved in the cabinet of the Mass. Hist. Society. These, as well as the Israel Williams papers, the
Col. William Williams’ papers (in the Pittsfield Athenæum), and much else, will be availed of thoroughly by
Prof. A. L. Perry in the <i>History of Williamstown</i>, which he has in progress. A coöperative <i>Memorial History
of Berkshire County</i>, edited by the historian of Pittsfield, is also announced, but a <i>History of Berkshire
County</i>, issued under the auspices of the Berkshire Historical Society, seems likely to anticipate it.</p>

During the Dutch occupation of New York
there were only two Catholics in New Amsterdam,
and according to Father Jogues, the Jesuit
missionary, they had no complaint to make that
they suffered on account of their faith. Father
Le Moyne, another missionary, was allowed to
come to New Netherland a few years later, and
administer the rites of the church to the few Romanists
then in the province, and in 1686 Governor
Dongan, himself of the Church of Rome,
reports that there were still only “a few” of his
co-religionists in the government.</p>

Being the first settlers of the province, the
Quakers had very naturally made affirmation
instead of an oath a matter of great importance.
Upon a revision of the laws following the resumption
of the government by Penn, a law
concerning the manner of giving evidence,
passed in 1701, was repealed by the queen in
1705, not because the English government intended
to deprive the Quakers of Pennsylvania
of their cherished privilege, but because it punished
false affirming with more severity than the
law of England required for false swearing.
Hence Gookin’s objections. The whole question
was not satisfactorily settled until the passage
of a law, and its approval by the king,
prescribing the forms of declaration of fidelity,
abjuration, and affirmation.</p>

During the following year, and as long as
the war lasted, the same £100,000 were yearly
voted, and bills to that amount emitted, secured
by a tax on property. Again, in 1764, the Indian
troubles about Fort Augusta caused another
emission of £55,000. The war with Spain
threatened Philadelphia, and £23,500 more were
voted. Again, in 1769, bills to the amount of
£14,000 were granted towards the relief of the
poor in Philadelphia, and £60,000 for the king’s

How rarely slaves were imported is shown
by the fact that of 1,062 entries for duty (a negro
imported for sale was taxed £4) during the period
from the 11th of March, 1746, to the 31st of
March, 1749, only 29 entries were of 49 slaves,
and 5 of these were brought on speculation, the
others being servants or seamen, and thus exempted
from duty. Slavery and the slave traffic
were never countenanced in New York, and much
less in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where the
Quakers early declared themselves opposed to
this institution.</p>

“Terra Canadensis” into north and south parts,
of which last section New York (discovered by
Hudson in 1608) is a subdivision, as are New
Jersey (discovered by the English, “under the
conduct of the Cabots,” in 1497) and Pennsylvania,
of which it is blindly said that it was discovered
“at the same time with the rest of the
adjacent continent.” The western limit of these

Governor Burnet, in his letter of December
16, 1723, perhaps alludes to it when he says: “I
have likewise enclosed a map of this province,
drawn by the surveyor Gen<sup>ll</sup>, Dr. Colden, with
great exactness from all surveys that have been
made formerly and of late in this province;” ...
but more probably Colden refers to it, in his letter
of December 4, 1726, to Secretary Popple, as
“a Map of this Province, which I am preparing
by the Governor’s Order.” As this last letter
(<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, v. 806) treats mainly of quit-rents,
and as this map illustrates the same as
fixed in the various patents, it is most likely that
the latter is the map now under consideration.
There is a map of the Livingston manor (1714)
in the <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, iii. 414, and papers concerning
it (1680-1795) are in the same. A map
of the Van Rensselaer manor (1767) is in <i>Idem.</i>,

<i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, i. 377; iv. 109. Colden was a Scotchman (born in 1688), who, after completing his
studies at the University of Edinburgh, came to Pennsylvania in 1708, where he practised as a physician, and
gathered the material for describing in the <i>Acta Upsaliensia</i> several hundred American plants. For a few
years after 1715 he was in England; but when Hunter came to New York as governor in 1720, he made Colden
surveyor-general and councillor, and ever after he was actively identified with New York. There is a
likeness of Colden in <i>Ibid.</i>, iii. 495. The Colden Papers are in the library of the N. Y. Historical Society. A
portion of them are the correspondence of Colden with Smith, the historian of New York, and with his father,
respecting alleged misstatements in Smith’s <i>History</i>, particularly as regards a scheme of Gov. Clarke to settle
Scotch Highlanders near Lake George. These letters were printed in the <i>Collections</i> of that society, second
series, vol. ii. (1849) p. 193, etc., and another group of similar letters makes part of vol. i. (p. 181) of the
<i>Publication Fund Series</i> of the same <i>Collections</i>. (See Vol. III. p. 412.) The main body, however, of the
Colden Papers occupy vols. ix. and x. of this last series (1876 and 1877). The earlier of these volumes contains
his official letter-books, 1760-1775, which “throw a flood of light upon the measures which were steadily
forcing New York into necessary resistance to arbitrary government.” The succeeding volume takes the
next ten years down to 1775.</p>

on the Trial of John Peter Zenger</i> (London, 1738) is signed by Indus Britannicus, who calls Hamilton’s
speech a “wild and idle harangue,” and aims to counteract “the approval of the paper called Common Sense.”
Cf. for Hamilton the chapter on the Bench and Bar in Scharf and Westcott’s <i>Philadelphia</i> (ii. 1501). “Andrew
Hamilton was the first American lawyer who gained more than a local reputation, and the only one
who did so in colonial times.” Lodge, <i>Short History</i>, 233, gives references on the courts and bar of Pennsylvania
and New York (pp. 232, 233, 316, 317). There is a portrait of Andrew Hamilton in the Penn.
Hist. Soc., and a photograph of it in Etting’s <i>Independence Hall</i>. The trial is canvassed in Chandler’s <i>Amer.

The Moravian Historical Society (Nazareth, Penna.) has taken active measures to preserve the records of
their missionary work. In 1860 it published at Philadelphia <i>A memorial of the dedication of monuments
erected by the Moravian Historical Society, to mark the sites of ancient missionary stations in New York
and Connecticut</i> [by W. C. Reichel], which contains an account of the Moravians in New York and Connecticut;
[Mission of] Shekomeko [N. Y.], by S. Davis; Visit of the committee [to Shekomeko and Wechquadnach],
and the proceedings of the society and dedication of the monuments.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The society also began a series of transactions in 1876, whose first volume included <i>Extracts from Zinzendorf’s
Diary of his second, and in part of his third journey among the Indians, the former to Shekomeko,
and the other among the Shawanese, on the Susquehanna. Transl. from a German MS. in the Bethlehem
archives. By Eugene Schaeffer</i> (1742), and <i>Names which the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians gave to
rivers, streams, and localities, within the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia,
with their significations</i>. <i>Prepared from a MS. by J. Heckewelder, by William C. Reichel.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">For the Moravians in Philadelphia, see Scharf and Westcott’s <i>Hist. of Philad.</i> (vol. ii. p. 1320, etc.), and
Abraham Ritter’s <i>Hist. of the Moravian Church in Philad. from its foundation in 1742</i> (Phil., 1857).
Poole’s <i>Index</i>, p. 870, will enable the reader to trace the literature of which the Moravians have been the subject.
The sect publish at Bethlehem a <i>Manual</i>, which is convenient for authoritative information.</p>

Jonathan Edwards wrote Brainerd’s life, using his diaries in part. In 1822 a new edition, by Sereno Edwards
Dwight, included journals (June, 1745, to June, 1746) that had been published separately, which had
been overlooked by Edwards. (Sabin, ii. nos. 7,339-7,346.) The <i>Journal of a two months’ tour with a view of
promoting religion among the frontier inhabitants of Pennsylvania, and introducing Christianity among
the Indians west of the Alegh-geny Mountains, by Charles Beatty</i> (London, 1768), is the result of a mission
planned in England, and is addressed to the Earl of Dartmouth and other trustees of the Indian Charity
School. In Perry’s <i>Amer. Episcopal Church</i>, chapter 19, is given an account of missionary labors among
the Mohawks and other Indian tribes. Gideon Hawley’s account of his journey among the Mohawks in 1753
is in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, iv., and <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, iii.</p>

His career is commemorated by Horatio Gates Jones in an address, <i>Andrew Bradford, the founder of
the newspaper press in the Middle States</i> (Philad., 1869). Cf. Scharf and Westcott’s <i>Philadelphia</i> (vol. iii.
ch. 48), on the press of Philadelphia; Thomas’s <i>Hist. of Printing</i> (Worcester, 1874), ii. p. 132; and Frederic
Hudson’s <i>Journalism in the United States</i> (N. Y., 1873), p. 60. The best known of the early Philadelphia
papers was, however, <i>The Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences and Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, which,
begun Dec. 24, 1728, passed with the fortieth number into the control of Benj. Franklin, who retained only
the secondary title for the paper. Cf. “History of a newspaper&mdash;the Pennsylvania Gazette,” in <i>Mag. of

<p class="pfc4">Of the <i>American Magazine</i>, published at Philadelphia in 1741, and the earliest magazine printed in the
British colonies, probably only three numbers were issued (Hildeburn, no. 688). It must not be confounded
with a later <i>American Magazine</i>, printed by W. Bradford, which lived through thirteen monthly numbers,
Oct., 1757, to Oct., 1758. It purported to be edited “by a society of gentlemen,” and Tyler (<i>Amer. Literature</i>,
ii. 306) calls it “the most admirable example of our literary periodicals in the colonial time.” Cf. Wallace’s

A method, prevailing widely at present, of forcing local pride and business enterprise into partnership has
produced in New York, as it has in other States, a series of county histories which may find in future antiquaries
more respect than historical students at present feel for them. The work of some of the local historical
societies, like those of Ulster, Oneida, Cayuga, and Buffalo, is conducted in general in a better spirit, and
its genuine antiquarian zeal is exemplified in such books as J. R. Simms’s <i>Frontiersmen of New York</i> (1882-83),
and in the conglomerate <i>History of the Schenectady patent in the Dutch and English times; being
contributions toward a history of the lower Mohawk Valley, by Jonathan Pearson and others; edited by

Chief among the architectural landmarks of old New York was the City Hall, on Wall Street, built in
1700, and taken down in 1812. (Cf. views in Valentine’s <i>Manual</i>, 1847 and 1866; <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, ix.
322; and Watson’s <i>Annals of New York</i>, p. 176.) Valentine’s <i>Manual</i> and his <i>Hist. of N. York</i> contain various
views of buildings and localities belonging to the early part of the eighteenth century. Particularly in
the <i>Manual</i>, see the views of early New York in the volume for 1858, with a view of Fort George and the city
from the southwest (1740). (Cf. <i>Appleton’s Journal</i>, viii. p. 353.) The <i>Manual</i> for 1862 contains a view of
the battery (p. 503); others of the foot of Wall Street (p. 506), of the great dock (p. 512), and of the East
River shore (p. 531),&mdash;all of 1746; and of the North River shore in 1740 (p. 549). The volume for 1865 contains
a history of Broadway, with historical views; that for 1866 a history of Wall Street, to be compared with
the treatment of the same subject by Mrs. Lamb in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">An engraving from Wm. Burgiss’s view of the Dutch church in New York, built 1727-37, is given in Valentine’s
<i>Hist. of N. Y. City</i>, p. 279.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A paper on the old tombs of Trinity is in <i>Harper’s Mag.</i>, Nov., 1876.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The <i>Manual</i> also preserves samples of the domestic architecture of the period. Old houses, especially
Dutch ones, are shown in the volumes for 1847, 1850, 1853, 1855. In that for 1858 we have in contrast the
Dutch Cortelyou house (1699) and the Rutgers mansion. Of famous colonial houses in New York city and
province, cuts may be noted of the following among others:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">Van Cortland House, in Mrs. Lamb’s <i>Homes of America</i> (1879), p. 696; Harper’s Mag., lii. 645; <i>Appleton’s

are about all that remain of the once famous
seaport town [Joppa] of provincial Maryland.”

“Capt. Teach, alias Blackbeard, the famous Pyrate,
came within the Capes of this Colony in
a Sloop of six Guns and twenty Men; whereof
our Governor having Notice, ordered two Sloops
to be fitted out, which fortunately met with him.
When Teach saw they were resolv’d to fight
him, he leap’d upon the Round-House of his
Sloop, and took a Glass of Liquor, and drank
to the Masters of the two Sloops, and bid Damnation
seize him that should give Quarter; but
notwithstanding his Insolence the two Sloops
soon boarded him, and kill’d all except Teach

Mr. Tyler throws some doubt upon the profession
of the same authorship conveyed in the

the other. The next year (1731) the earlier
poem is said to have been reprinted at Annapolis
with another on Bacon’s Rebellion. (<i>Hist.

is the best known map of this period. The map
which was engraved for Jefferson’s <i>Notes on

Albemarle Sound to Lake Erie, was for the region
east of the Alleghanies, based on Fry and
Jefferson, and on Scull’s <i>Map of Pennsylvania</i>,
“which was constructed chiefly on actual survey,”

Cf. M. C. Tyler, <i>Hist. Amer. Literature</i>, ii.
270; J. Esten Cooke’s <i>Virginia</i>, 362. Stith
speaks of Byrd’s library (3,625 vols.) as “the
best and most copious collection of books in our
part of America.” Byrd possessed the MS. of
the Virginia Company Records, already referred
to (Vol. III. p. 158). See some account of the
Westover library in Maxwell’s <i>Virginia Hist.
Reg.</i>, iv. 87, and <i>Spotswood Letters</i>, i. p. x., where
something is said of other Virginia libraries of
this time. Grahame (<i>United States</i>, i. 148) evidently
mistakes these manuscripts of Byrd’s for
something which he supposed was published in
the early part of that century on the history of
Virginia, and which he says Oldmixon refers to.</p>

One of the earliest accounts of the college is
in the paper of 1696-98 (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. v.
section xii.). Palmer (<i>Calendar</i>, p. 61) gives a
bill for facilitating the payment of donations to
the college (1698). Its charter is given in <i>The
Present State</i>, etc., by Blair and others, was
printed at Williamsburg in 1758, and is found in
the <i>History of the College of William and Mary</i>
(1660-1874), printed with the general catalogue
at Richmond in 1874. An oration by E. Randolph
on the founders of William and Mary College
was printed at Williamsburg in 1771. Jones
in 1724 gave a rather melancholy picture of the
institution, then a quarter of a century old. It
is, he says, “a college without a chapel, without
a scholarship, and without a statute; a library
without books, comparatively speaking, and a
president without a fixed salary, till of late.”
(Hugh Jones’s <i>Present State</i>, 83.) Other sketches
are <i>Historical Sketch of the College of William and
Mary</i>, Richmond, 1866 (20 pp.); <i>History of William
and Mary College from the foundation</i>, Baltimore,
1870; and Mr. C. F. Richardson’s “Old
Colonial College” in the <i>Mag. of Amer. History</i>,
Nov., 1884. Richardson, together with Henry
Alden Clark, also edited <i>The College Book</i>, which
includes an account of the college, as of others
in the United States. Doyle (<i>English in America</i>,
363) says, “We may well doubt if the college
did much for the colony.... It is evident it
was nothing better than a boarding-school, in
which Blair had no small difficulty in contending
against the extravagance engendered by the home
training of his pupils.”</p>

The <i>Canadian Antiquarian</i> (iv. 76) describes

All the country of which North and South
Carolina form a part was known for a long
time by the name of Florida, a name given by
early Spanish explorers. The English, after the
settlement of Virginia, called the region in that
direction South Virginia. From 1629, in the
reign of Charles I., the name Carolana (as in
Heath’s claim), and at times Carolina, began to
be used (see <i>S. C. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i. p. 200). At
length, when the new charter was obtained, the
name as it now stands was definitely applied to
the region granted to the Proprietors. If they
had wished, they could have adopted some other
name. It happened that the fort built by the
French in Florida was called in Latin “arx Carolina”;
a Charles fort was also built by them in
what is now South Carolina,&mdash;both so named in
honor of Charles IX. of France; yet they did
not apply the name to the territory, which they
continued to call Florida. Gov. Glen in his <i>Description
of South Carolina</i> (1761) says: “The
name Carolina, still retained by the English, is
generally thought to have been derived from
Charles the Ninth of France, in whose reign
Admiral Coligny made some settlements on the
Florida coast.”</p>

Clarendon was the companion of Charles II.
in his exile, and rendered great service in his
restoration. We all know the services of General
Monk (preëminently the restorer of the king),
afterwards created Duke of Albemarle. Sir
George Carteret, governor of the Isle of Jersey,
opposed Cromwell, and gave refuge to Charles,
the Duke of York, the Earl of Clarendon, and
others. Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper (Earl of
Shaftesbury) was particularly commended to the
king by General Monk as one of the council,
and his abilities raised him to the chancellor-ship.
Sir John Colleton had impoverished himself
in the royal cause; and after Cromwell’s
success retired to Barbadoes, till the Restoration.
Lord Berkeley had faithfully followed
Charles in his exile; and his brother, Sir William,
as governor of Virginia, caused that colony
to adhere to the king, as their rightful sovereign.
The Earl of Craven was of the Privy Council,
and held a military command under the king.

January 7, 1664-5. “Minute: although the
county of Clarendon, etc., be, for the present,
under the government of Sir J. Yeamans, yet it
is purposed that a part of it, south and west of
Cape Romania, shall be a distinct government
and be called Craven County.” <i>Abstracts, Coll.
S. C. Hist. Soc.</i>, i. p. 97.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Chalmers (“Annals,” in Carroll’s <i>Hist. Coll.</i>,
ii. p. 289) says Yeamans and his colonists arrived
at Cape Fear “during the autumn of 1665.”
Dr. Hawks gives May, 1664, on p. 83 (vol. ii.),
and 1665 on pp. 181 and 453. From the <i>Charleston
Year Book</i>, 1883, p. 359, it appears Yeamans
had ample powers in 1665 to explore the coast
south and west of Cape Roman. He did sail
from Barbadoes for that purpose, in October,
and did go at that time to Cape Fear, of which
he was governor by appointment nine months
before. He may have been at Barbadoes merely
for the purpose of making ready for that exploration.
We have no reason to doubt the settling
at Cape Fear in May, 1664, whether Yeamans
was or was not, at that time, the leader of the
colonists. In Sandford’s <i>Relation</i> (1666) the expression
“the great and growing necessityes of
the English colony in Charles river,” when Yeamans
arrived (November, 1665), seems to refer
to colonists already there. It was for the interests
of the Proprietors to secure&mdash;as they did in
1665&mdash;the services of such a man not only for
Clarendon, but as their “lieutenant-general”
for further services southward in their policy
above indicated. The difficulty appears to be
that Sir John had a policy of his own,&mdash;to grow
rich; and that his real home was all the while
in Barbadoes. He did not sacrifice himself for
the emolument of their lordships either at Cape
Fear or at Ashley River, as will be apparent in
our subsequent narrative.</p>

Under their charter they could grant titles
of honor, provided they were not like those of
England. A provincial nobility was accordingly
created under the titles of Landgraves and Cassiques.
The province was divided into counties;
each county into eight signories, eight baronies,
and four precincts, and each precinct into
six colonies for the common people. Each of
the other divisions (that is, excluding the precincts)
was to contain 12,000 acres; the signories
for the Proprietors, the baronies for the provincial
nobility, to be perpetually annexed to the
hereditary title. These nobles were, in the first
instance, to be appointed by their lordships. In
their subsequent endeavors to establish this
scheme of government quite a large number of
provincial nobles were created: the philosopher
Locke, James Carteret, Sir John Yeamans
to begin with, and many others, from time to
time, till the title of Landgrave&mdash;and there were
Cassiques also&mdash;must have appeared to the recipient
as ridiculous as it was to Albemarle to
be first Palatine, Craven first High Constable,
Berkeley first Chancellor, Ashley Chief Justice,
Carteret Admiral, and Colleton High Steward,
of Carolina.</p>

This, it is true, was not contrary to the charter,
but there is no doubt that the majority of
the early settlers were dissenters, and the establishment
of this Church, to be supported by taxation,
occasioned much dissatisfaction and active
opposition.</p>

Towards 1700, “about half of the Albemarle
settlement was composed of Quakers.” (Hawks,
ii. p. 89.) They had been, at an earlier day,
driven from Massachusetts and Virginia. (Ib. p.
362.) They did not, however, at any time amount
to 2,000, and constituted a small minority of the
whole population in the colony (p. 369).</p>

It is said by historians that a sort of constitution
had been given the colony at Albemarle,
in 1667, when Stephens became governor.
It is explained by Chalmers (“Political Annals,”
p. 524, as cited by Dr. Hawks, ii. p. 147), and
said not to be now extant, and that the provisions
were simple and satisfactory to the colony.
The Hon. W. L. Saunders, the present
Secretary of State of North Carolina, has discussed
this subject, and shows from the Shaftesbury
Papers, which were unknown to Chalmers,
that what has been considered a constitution
was merely the “Concessions of January 7th,
1665,” a transcript of which had been sent to
Governor Stephens. See pamphlet, 1885, p. 31,
<i>et seq.</i></p>

Bancroft, ii. pp. 161, 162, ed. 1856, views
the Culpepper rebellion as an outgrowth of
the spirit of freedom, not mere lawlessness.
See documents in Hawks’ <i>North Carolina</i>, ii.
pp. 374-377; also the “Answer of the Lords
Proprietors,” p. 38 of <i>North Carolina under the
Proprietary Government</i>, pamphlet, 1884. Compare
this self-excusatory answer with the manly
“remonstrance of the inhabitants of Pasquotank,”
who wanted, first of all, “a free Parliament.”
This manifesto has been ridiculed by
Chalmers and Hawks; Wheeler appears to have
the right conception of it.</p>

The histories of North Carolina&mdash;through
lack of records&mdash;are deficient in explaining the
political aims of the people. The lack of records
of the popular assembly will be noticed

His commission as deputy governor was
to come from the Executive in South Carolina.
The governor there&mdash;Tynte&mdash;was dead, and
Hyde’s formal commission delayed. In December,
1710, it was proposed among the Proprietors
to appoint a separate governor for North
Carolina. Hyde received the appointment, and
was sworn in&mdash;the first “Governor of North
Carolina”&mdash;in 1712. <i>Abstracts, etc., N. C.</i>, p.
23. The population of the colony was at this
time about 7,000, white and black.</p>

We can, to some extent, understand the
aim, at this time, of the popular party, from
letters of Gov. Spotswood (July 28th and 30th).
The people demanded <i>the repeal of certain laws</i>.
One of these was probably that which excluded
Quakers from all offices for which oaths were
a prerequisite, as no reservation was made for
conscientious scruples; and another, that which
imposed a fine of £5 on any one promoting his
own election or not qualifying as prescribed.
Perhaps the disaffection was more deeply seated.
In 1717 the Rev. John Urmstone said the people
<i>acknowledged no power not derived from themselves</i>.
This opinion, at any rate, appears to
be consistent with the tenor of events. See
Hawks, ii. pp. 423, 426, 509, and 512; and
<i>N. Carolina under the Proprietary Government</i>,
p. 36 (pamphlet), 1884.</p>

<i>Coll. of S. C. Hist. Soc.</i>, i. p. 176. This letter
may be sarcastic, if the “great dislike” of
rebellion applies to the people, but we are sure it
is untrue in saying that the almost unanimous
action of South Carolina was the action of “several
of the inhabitants.” It is likely, also, to be
untrue in intimating that the assembly joined in
such an address. Hawks, ii. p. 561. See Yonge’s
account of the way in which the affairs of the
Proprietors were often transacted by their secretary.
Some Proprietors lived away from London;
others were minors and represented by
proxy.</p>

About 1743, John Lord Carteret (Earl of

land, all other rights being conveyed to the
Crown. This strip of land was just below the

the Pacific. From notices in Hewat’s “South

At the close of the proprietary government
the population numbered 10,000; it numbered
in 1750 about 50,000. Its exports were 61,528
barrels of tar, 12,055 barrels of pitch, 10,429
barrels of turpentine, 762,000 staves, 61,580 bushels
of corn, 100,000 hogsheads of tobacco, 10,000

30,000 pounds of deer-skins, besides wheat,
rice, bread, potatoes, bees-wax, tallow, bacon,
lard, lumber, indigo, and tanned leather. Cf.
Martin and Wheeler. The former says 100
hogsheads of tobacco; but he had given 800
hogsheads as the crop about 1677, when the
whole population amounted to only 1,400; the
latter is authority for changing this item to
100,000 hogsheads.</p>

The city council of Charleston (S. C.) have
obtained copies of some of the Shaftesbury
Papers recently given by the family to the State
Paper Office in London. Among them is a MS.
of 36 pp., being “<i>A Relation of a Voyage on the
Coast of the Province of Carolina, formerly called
Florida, in the Continent of Northern America,

this narrative we are indebted to the Hon. W.
A. Courtenay, mayor of Charleston. From the
new facts brought to light in these Shaftesbury
Papers we must alter, in some particulars, the
extant history of the first English settlement in
South Carolina.</p>

In the <i>Sketch of the History of South Carolina</i>

26th July, 1669. At the same time West’s commission,
dated 27th July, confers such power upon
him as “Governor and Commander-in-Chief,”
<i>till the arrival of the fleet at Barbadoes</i>, that
we cannot suppose Sayle was on board at that
time. The difficulty is removed in the Shaftesbury
MSS., and by the filling up of the commission
with the name of Sayle at Bermuda.</p>

From the Shaftesbury Papers. We should
not fail to notice here that the aged governor
had written, on 25th June, to Earl Shaftesbury
for the procurement of Rev. S. Bond, of Bermuda
(who had been ordained by Joseph Hall,
Bishop of Exeter), to settle in the colony; and
that their lordships authorized an offer to Mr.
Bond of five hundred acres of land and £40 per
annum. It is not known that he came.</p>

[See Vol. II. ch. 4.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] The writer of
this narrative has examined Albemarle Point,
the spot selected by the English for their settlement:
a high bluff, facing the east and the entrance
of the bay, and running out between a
creek and an impassable marsh, and easily defended
by cutting a deep trench across the tongue
of land. Precisely the same defensible advantages,
with the additional one of a far better
harbor, lay opposite at a tongue of land called
Oyster Point, between the Ashley and Cooper
rivers.</p>

The earliest notice we have of the population
is from the Shaftesbury Papers, under date
20 January, 1672 [N. S.]: “By our records it appears
that 337 men and women, 62 children or
persons under 16 years of age, is the full number
of persons who have arrived in this country
in and since the first fleet out of England to this
day.” Deducting for deaths and absences at the
above date, there remained of the men 263 able
to bear arms. Though the colony increased in
wealth and importance, there was for many years
but a slow increase in the number of white inhabitants.</p>

How pompous is article 7: “Any Landgrave
or Cassique, when it is his right to choose, shall
take any of the Barronies appropriated to the
Nobility, which is not already planted on by some
other Nobleman.” These provincial nobles, made
so, in the first instance, by appointment of the
Proprietors, were to be legislators by right. Yet
in this same year (1672), their lordships issued
an offer to settlers from Ireland and promised
that whoever carried or caused to go to Carolina
600 men should be a Landgrave with four baronies;
and if 900 he should be Landgrave and
also nominate a Cassique; and if 1,200, should
also nominate two Cassiques. This was scattering
at random the hereditary right of legislating
over the freemen of the colony.</p>

A third set was sent out (dated January 12,
1682), and to please the Scots who were willing
to emigrate, further alterations were made, and
a fourth set (dated August 17, 1682, and containing
126 articles) was despatched to Governor
Morton. Last of all, a fifth set (dated April 11,
1698, and containing only 41 articles), was sent
out by the hands of Major Daniel, and with it,
as an inducement for a favorable reception, six
blank patents for landgraves and eight for cassiques.
When the third set was sent, the sentiments
of the people with regard to the whole
subject may be fairly represented as in the letter
to Sothel in 1691,&mdash;that, inasmuch as their
lordships, under their hands and seals, had ordered
that no person should be a member of the
council nor of parliament, nor choose lands due
to him, unless he subscribed his submission to
this last set of the Constitutions; “the people
remembering their oaths to the first, and deeming
these not to be agreeable to the royal charters,
which direct the assent and approbation of
the people to all laws and constitutions, did deny
to receive the said Fundamental Constitutions.”
Governor Morton, in 1685, actually turned out
of parliament the majority of the representatives
for refusing to sign the third set, though
they had sworn to the first set. In consequence,
the laws that year enacted were enacted by
only seven representatives and by eight of the
deputies of the Proprietors.</p>

At this time, one passed, in riding up the
road, the plantations of Matthews, Green, Starkey,
Gray, Grimball, Dickeson, and Izard, on
the Cooper River; and further up, those of Sir
John Yeamans, Landgrave Bellinger, Colonel
Gibbes, Mr. Schenking, Colonel Moore, Colonel
Quarry, and Sir Nathaniel Johnson. On the left,
Landgrave West, Colonel Godfrey, Dr. Trevillian,
and Mr. Colleton, had plantations. Westward
from Charlestown lived Col. Paul Grimball,
Landgrave Morton, Blake (a Proprietor),
and Landgrave Axtel; while many residences
in the town, as those of Landgrave Smith and
Colonel Rhett, were said to be “very handsome
buildings,” with fifteen or more “which deserve
to be taken notice of.” From these residences
could be seen entering the harbor vessels from
Jamaica, Barbadoes, and the Leeward Isles, from
Virginia and other colonies, and the always
welcome ships from England. An active and
lucrative commerce employed many ships to
various ports in North America, and also twenty-two
ships between Charles Town and England;
about twelve were owned by the colonists; half
of these had been built by themselves. The
inhabitants (1708) numbered nearly 10,000; the
whites and negroes being about equal, with 1,400
Indian slaves. (Letter of Governor and Council,
Sept. 17, 1708, in <i>S. C. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, ii. p. 217.)
For a few years the whites had decreased in
number on account of epidemics and disaffection
with regard to the tenure of lands (the nature
of this disaffection may be noticed in what
is recorded in the preceding narrative sketch of
North Carolina); while negroes were regularly
imported by the English traders and by Northern
ships, as the plantation work extended, particularly
the culture of rice, which had become
the most valuable export. A little later (1710)
the whites were computed at .12 of the whole
inhabitants, negro slaves .22, and Indian subjects
.66. Of the whites, the planters were .70,
merchants about .13, and artisans .17. With respect
to religion, the Episcopalians were then
computed to be .42, the Presbyterians, with the
French Huguenots, .45, Anabaptists .10, and the
Quakers .03. (Inserted in Governor Glen’s <i>Description
of South Carolina</i>.)</p>

Rev. Mr. Marston says, “Many of the members
of the Commons House that passed this
disqualifying law are constant absentees from
the Church, and eleven of them were never
known to receive the Sacrament of the Lord’s
Supper,” though for five years past he had administered
it in his church at least six times a
year. (“Case of Dissenters;” and Archdale.)
The same assembly had passed an act against
blasphemy and profaneness, “which they always
made a great noise about,” wrote Landgrave
Smith, “although they are some of the most
profanest in the country themselves.” See <i>Sketch

The folly, or grasping cupidity, of the Proprietors
plainly appears in their action respecting
these lands (<i>S. C. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i. p. 192),
21 Nov., 1718: “Lots drawn this day for the
119,000 acres of land in South Carolina; that
48,000 acres should be taken up in South Carolina
by each Proprietor for the use of himself
and heirs, 24,000 of which may be of the Yemassee
land if thought fit, ... at a pepper corn
rent, etc.”</p>

We should add along with this avowal of
loyalty, which was no doubt sincere, the prophetic
language of Colonel Rhett, in December,
1719, as mentioned in Chalmers, ii. p. 93: If
this “revolt is not cropt in the bud, they will set
up for themselves against his majesty.” And
in the same strain we understand the extract of
a letter (Nov. 14, 1719, in <i>S. C. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>,
ii. p. 237), concluding, “I must tell you, sir, if
the much greater part of the most substantial

In <i>S. C. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, ii. p. 119, is an abstract
(from state papers, London) of a “draft”
for new instructions, that the governor should
approve or disapprove of the speaker and clerk,
and refuse assent to any law appointing civil
officers; and that money bills should be framed
by a committee of the council joined with a committee
of the “Lower House of Assembly,” as
they should in future be called. We are not
aware that such instructions were ever sent.
Johnson allowed them to appoint their clerk
(1731), they pleading <i>custom</i>, and giving instances
of the same in other colonies.</p>

Samuel Horsey was made governor in July,
1738, but died before he left England. Glen
was appointed in his place in October, 1738.
We may state here that the elder William Rhett
died 1723, the second James Moore 1724, President
Middleton 1737, Nicholas Trott 1740,
Alexander Skene 1741. Lieutenant-Governor
Bull was father of the later lieutenant-governor

<span class="smcap">Estimates of Population in South Carolina.</span>
1672. Joseph Dalton, secretary to Lord
Ashley. Whites, 391: men 263, women 69, children
under 16 years 59. 1680. T. A. in <i>Carroll’s
Coll.</i>, 2d, p. 82, about 1,200. 1682. Same, about
2,500. 1699. E. Randolph to Lords of Trade
(<i>Sketch of Hist. S. C.</i>, p. 443) gives white militia
not above 1,500 and four negroes to one white;
and 1,100 families, English and French. 1700.
Hewatt, <i>Carroll’s Coll.</i>, 1st, p. 132, computes
whites from 5,000 to 6,000. 1701. Humphreys’
<i>Hist. Account</i>, etc., p. 25, computes whites above
7,000. 1703. By estimate for five years, allowable
from statements of the governor and council
(<i>Sketch, Hist. S. C.</i>, p. 232), we may put the
population in 1703 at 8,160. 1708. Governor
Johnson and council compute 9,580: freemen
1,360, freewomen 900, white servant men 60, white
servant women 60, white free children 1,700,
in all 4,080; negro men slaves 1,800, negro
women slaves, 1,100, negro children slaves 1,200,
in all 4,100; Indian men slaves 500, Indian
women slaves 600, Indian children slaves 300,
in all 1,400. 1708. Oldmixon, <i>Carroll’s Coll.</i>, ii.
p. 460, computes total 12,000. 1720. Governor
Johnson, whites 6,400; at same date the Revolutionary
governor and council report whites
9,000; militiamen not over 2,000. From a sworn
statement the taxpayers of the eleven parishes
were 1,305, and their slaves 11,828 (see <i>A Chapter
in Hist.S. C.</i>, p. 56). Chalmers multiplies 1,305
by four, and makes total white and black 17,048;
but 9,000 whites and 11,828 blacks give 20,828.
1724. Hewatt, p. 266, computes whites 14,000.
In Glen’s <i>Description</i>, etc., in <i>Carroll’s Coll.</i>, ii.
p. 261, the same number is given; also slaves,
mostly negroes, 32,000; total 46,000. 1743.
Chalmers’ papers in possession of Mr. George
Bancroft, letter of McCulloch, comptroller, computes
negroes at 40,000. 1751. Same authority;
letter from Glen; also <i>Carroll’s Coll.</i>, ii. p. 218;
whites 25,000, negro taxables 39,000; say total
64,000. 1756. Same authority; Governor Lyttleton
says the militia amounted to 5,500 men.
Computing negro increase at 1,000 per annum,
we estimate a total of 72,500. 1763. In a <i>Short
Description</i>, etc., <i>Carroll’s Coll.</i>, ii. p. 478. Whites
between 30,000 and 40,000, negroes about 70,000;
say total 105,000. 1765. Hewatt, p. 503. Militia
between 7,000 and 8,000, from which he
computes the whites near 40,000, negroes “not
less than” 80,000 or 90,000; say total 123,000.
1770. Chalmers’ MSS.; Lieutenant-Governor
Bull gives negroes returned in last tax 75,178;
militiamen 10,000; say 125,178. 1770. Wells’
<i>Register</i> says negroes 81,728, and free blacks
159. 1773. Wells’ <i>Register and Almanac</i> for
1774. Whites 65,000, negroes 110,000 (militiamen
13,000); total 175,000. Chalmers’ MSS.;
Dr. George Milligan gives for 1775, whites 70,000,
negroes 104,000, militiamen 14,000, which
makes 174,000. 1790. U. S. Census. Whites

Vol. III. p. 125. The map of Florida in
the 1618 edition of Lescarbot, in which the
Rivière de May is made to flow from a “Grand
Lac” in the interior, is said to have afforded
in part the groundwork of De Laet’s map. Cf.
also the map of Virginia and Florida (1635) in

in printing the second charter granted by
Charles II. (<i>Hist. Coll.</i>, ii. 37), speaks of the
original as being in the possession of Harvard
University; but he must refer to the early
printed copy, not the parchment. Both charters
may be found in the <i>Revised Statutes of
North Carolina</i>, 1837, and in the <i>Statutes at
Large of South Carolina</i>, 1836. Hawks (vol. ii.
p. 107) gives a synopsis of the two in parallel
columns; and they are given in French and
English in <i>Mémoires des Commissaires du Roi</i>,
etc., vol. iv. (Paris, 1757) p. 554; and on p. 586,

<p class="pfc4">The most familiar portrait of Locke is Kneller’s,
which has been often engraved. It was
painted in 1697, and the several engravings by
Vertue (1713, etc.) appeared in the <i>Works</i> of
Locke, published in folio in London, in 1722
and 1727, and elsewhere, sometimes with different
framework, and of reduced size, in the
<i>Familiar Letters</i> of 1742 (fourth edition). The
same likeness is the one given in editions of
<i>Lodge’s Portraits</i>. There is also a folio mezzotint
by John Smith (J. C. Smith, <i>Brit. Mezzotint
Portraits</i>, iii. 1190). A different head is that
engraved by James Basire in the London editions
of the <i>Works</i>, 1801 and 1812.</p>

the text in his <i>Historical Collections</i> (ii. p. 9),

appreciating the fact that the incorrectness of
early maps is an index of contemporary ideas,
with which the historian finds it indispensable
to deal.</p>

by a map called “A new description of Carolina
by order of the Lords Proprietors,” which shows
the coast from the Chesapeake to St. Augustine.
The book throws no light on the sources
of the map; but Kohl, who has a sketch of the
map in his Washington collection (no. 211),
thinks White’s map served for the North Carolina
coast, and Wm. Sayle’s surveys for the
more southerly parts. Kohl says that the boundary
line here given between Virginia and Carolina
is laid down for the first time on a map.
The river May flows from a large “Ashley
lake.”</p>

this movement to an enforced religion.</p>

In the spring before this attack a New England
man, Rev. Joseph Lord, then ministering
not far from Charlestown, was congratulating
himself by letter to Samuel Sewall, of Boston
(writing from Dorchester, in South Carolina,
March 25, 1706), on “freedom from annoyance
by y<sup>e</sup> Spaniards, especially considering all, so
soon after the proclamation of war, began with
them.” He then goes on to inform his correspondent
that he believed some of the neighboring
tribes to be wandering remnants of the
Narragansetts and Pequods. <i>N. E. Hist. and

A German version of the first edition was
printed at Hamburg in 1715 as <i>Das Gros-Britannische
Scepter in der Neuen Welt</i>; and Theodor
Arnold published in 1744 a translation of the
second edition, called <i>Das Britische Reich in
America</i>, reproducing Moll’s map, but giving
the names in German. Carroll’s <i>Hist. Collections</i>

It was reprinted at Raleigh in 1860. A work
called <i>The Natural History of North Carolina
by John Brickell, M. D.</i>, Dublin, 1737, is Lawson’s
book, with some transpositions, changes,
and omissions. (Carter-Brown, iii. no. 560; Brinley,
ii. no. 3,843.) This last book is sufficiently
changed not to be considered a mere careless
reprint of Lawson, as J. A. Allen points out in
his <i>Bibliog. of Cetacea and Sirenia</i>, no. 208.
Brickell was a physician settled in North Carolina.
A German translation of Lawson by M.
Vischer, <i>Allerneuste Beschreibung der Provinz
Carolina in West Indien</i>, was printed at Hamburg
in 1712; and again in 1722. (Sabin, iii.
no. 10,957; v. no. 39,451, etc.; Carter-Brown,
iii. nos. 119, 125, 158, 169, 233; Cooke, no. 1,409;

Field, <i>Indian Bibliog.</i>, nos. 896-899; Brinley,
ii. no. 3,873.) Quaritch (1885) priced the original
1709 edition at £5, and I find it also quoted at
£6 6<i>s.</i> The German version repeats Lawson’s
map, and also has one called “Louisiana am
Fluss Mississippi.”</p>

Lawson’s book was accompanied by a map,
and a part of it, giving the North Carolina
coast, is reproduced by Dr. Hawks (ii. 103).
Mr. Deane’s copy has the map. Prof. F. M.
Hubbard, writing in 1860 in the <i>North American
Review</i>, said, “We know after much inquiry
of the existence of only four copies in this country.
About 1820, a copy then thought to be
unique was offered for sale at auction in North
Carolina and brought nearly sixty dollars.” The
book now is less rare than this writer supposed.</p>

In April, 1883, there was formed in New

the presidency of John Jay, with vice-presidents
to represent each of the distinct settlements
of French Protestants prior to 1787,&mdash;Staten

The latest writer on the theme, Doyle, in his
<i>English in America</i>, thinks Hewatt “may probably
be trusted in matters of notoriety.” Grahame
(iii. 78) says: “Hewit is a most perplexing
writer. A phrase of continual recurrence
with him is ‘about this time,’&mdash;the meaning of
which he leaves to the conjecture of readers and
the laborious investigation of scholars, as he
scarcely ever particularizes a date.” Again he
adds (ii. p. 110): “While he abstains from the
difficult task of relating the history of North
Carolina, he selects the most interesting features
of its annals, and transfers them to the history
of the southern province. His errors, though
hardly honest, were probably not the fruit of
deliberate misrepresentation.” Cf. Sprague’s
<i>Annals of the Amer. Pulpit</i>, iii. p. 251.</p>

Grahame (ii. 167) says of Chalmers that

discover his meaning or reconcile his apparent
inconsistency in different passages.”</p>

The copy referred to is also marked in Mr.
Chalmers’ autograph as “from the author to

it is spoken of as “apparently entirely unknown,”
and having the bookplate of George
Buchanan with a manuscript note, “Not published,
corrected for the press by me, G. B.”
No such evidences of Buchanan’s ownership are
now in the volume, and the title as given by
Rich is more extended than that written by

was printed separately as a pamphlet, at Charleston, in 1845. A writer in this same <i>Review</i> (Jan., 1852)
deplores the apathy of the Southern people and the indifference of Southern writers to the study of their local
history. In the series of the <i>Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science</i>, Mr.

The corporate seal adopted had two faces.
That for the authentication of legislative acts,
deeds, and commissions contained this device:
two figures resting upon urns, from which flowed
streams typifying the rivers forming the northern
and southern boundaries of the province. In
their hands were spades, suggesting agriculture
as the chief employment of the settlers. Above
and in the centre was seated the genius of the
Colony, a spear in her right hand, the left placed
upon a cornucopia, and a liberty cap upon her
head. Behind, upon a gentle eminence, stood a
tree, and above was engraven this legend, <i>Colonia
Georgia Aug</i>. On the other face,&mdash;which
formed the common seal to be affixed to grants,
orders, and certificates,&mdash;were seen silk-worms
in the various stages of their labor, and the
appropriate motto, <i>Non sibi sed aliis</i>. This inscription
not only proclaimed the disinterested
motives and intentions of the trustees, but it
suggested that the production of silk was to
be reckoned among the most profitable employments
of the colonists,&mdash;a hope not destined
to be fulfilled.</p>

As Captain-General he was entitled to
command all the land and naval forces of the
province, and by him were all officers of
the militia to be appointed. As Governor-in-chief
he was a constituent part of the General
Assembly, and possessed the sole power of adjourning,
proroguing, convening, and dissolving
that body. It rested with him to approve or to
veto any bill passed by the Council and the
Assembly. All officers who did not receive
their warrants directly from the Crown were
appointed by him: and if vacancies occurred,
by death or removal, in offices usually filled by
the immediate nomination of the King, the
appointees of the governor acted until the
pleasure of the home government was signified.
He was the custodian of the Great Seal, and
as Chancellor exercised within the province
powers of judicature similar to those reposed
in the High Chancellor of England. He was
to preside in the Court of Errors, composed of
himself and the members of Council as judges,
hearing and determining all appeals from the
superior courts. As Ordinary, he collated to
all vacant benefices, granted probate of wills,
and allowed administration upon the estates
of those dying intestate. By him were writs
issued for the election of representatives to sit
in the Commons House of Assembly. As Vice-Admiral,
while he did not sit in the court of
vice-admiralty,&mdash;a judge for that court being
appointed by the Crown,&mdash;in time of war he
could issue warrants to that court empowering
it to grant commissions to privateers. With
him resided the ability to pardon all crimes
except treason and murder. It was optional with
him to select as his residence such locality
within the limits of the province as he deemed
most convenient for the transaction of the public
business, and he might direct the General
Assembly to meet at that point. He was invested
with authority, for just cause, to suspend
any member of Council, and, in a word, might
“do all other necessary and proper things
in such manner and under such regulations as
should, upon due consideration, appear to be
best adapted to the circumstances of the colony.”
The King’s Council was to consist of
twelve members in ordinary and of two extraordinary
members. They were to be appointed
by the Crown, and were to hold office during His
Majesty’s pleasure. In the absence of the governor
and lieutenant-governor, the senior member
of the Council in Ordinary administered the
government. When sitting as one of the three
branches of the legislature the Council was
styled the Upper House of Assembly. It also
acted as Privy Council to the governor, assisting
him in the conduct of public affairs. In
this capacity the members were to convene
whenever the governor saw fit to summon
them. When sitting as an Upper House, the
Council met at the same time with the Commons
House of Assembly, and was presided
over by the lieutenant-governor, or, in his absence,
by the senior member present. The
forms of procedure resembled those observed
in the House of Lords in Great Britain.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The qualification of an elector was the ownership
of fifty acres of land in the parish or district
in which he resided and voted; that of a representative,
was the proprietorship of five hundred
acres of land in any part of the province.
Writs of election were issued by order of the
Governor in Council under the Great Seal of
the province, were tested by him, and were
returnable in forty days. When convened, the
Representatives were denominated the Commons
House of Assembly. Choosing its own
speaker, who was presented to the governor for
approbation, this body,&mdash;composed of the immediate
representatives of the people, and conforming
in its legislative and deliberative conduct to
the precedents established for the governance
of the English House of Commons,&mdash;when convened,
continued its session until dissolved by
the governor. It claimed and enjoyed the exclusive
right of originating bills for the appropriation
of public moneys. Thus constituted, the Upper
and Lower Houses formed the General Assembly
of the province and legislated in its behalf. Bills
which passed both Houses were submitted to the
governor for his consideration. If approved by
him, the Seal of the Colony was attached, and
they were duly filed. Authenticated copies were
then prepared and transmitted for the information
and sanction of the Home Government.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Provision was also made for the establishment
of a “General Court,” of a “Court of Session
of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery,”
and of courts of inferior jurisdiction.
There was also a “Court of Admiralty.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The presiding judge was styled Chief-Justice
of Georgia. He was a “barrister at law” who
had attended at Westminster, was appointed
by warrant under His Majesty’s sign-manual
and signet, and enjoyed a salary of £500, raised
by annual grant of Parliament. The assistant
justices were three in number. They received
no salaries except on the death or in the absence
of the chief-justice, and held their appointments
from the governor.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Arrangements were also made for appointment
of Collectors of Customs, of a Register of
Deeds, of a Receiver of Quit Rents, of a Surveyor-General,
of a Secretary of the Province,
of a Clerk of Council, of a Provost Marshal, of
an Attorney-General, and of other necessary
officers.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The device approved for a public seal was
as follows: On one face was a figure representing
the Genius of the Colony offering a skein
of silk to His Majesty, with the motto, “Hinc
laudem sperate Coloni,” and this inscription
around the circumference: “Sigillum Provinciæ
nostræ Georgiæ in America.” On the other
side appeared His Majesty’s arms, crown, garter,
supporters, and motto, with the inscription:
“Georgius II. Dei Gratia Britanniæ, Franciæ, et
Hiberniæ Rex, Fidei Defensor, Brunsvici et
Luneburgi Dux, Sacri Romani Imperii Archi
Thesaurarius et Princeps Elector.”</p>

[This important series of tracts, edited at
Halle, in Germany, by Samuel Urlsperger, was
begun in 1734, with the general title, <i>Ausführliche
Nachricht von den Saltzburgischen Emigranten</i>.
It was reissued in 1735. Judging
from the copies in Harvard College library,
both editions had the engraved portrait of
Tomo-cachi, with his nephew, and the map of
Savannah County. The 1735 edition had a
special title (following the general one), <i>Der
Ausführlichen Nachrichten von der Königlich-Gross-Britannischen
Colonie Saltzburgischer
Emigranten in America, Erster Theil</i>. In the
“vierte continuation” of this part there is at
p. 2073 the large folding map of the county
of Savannah. With the sixth continuation a
“Zweyter Theil” begins, with a general title
(1736), and a “Dritter Theil” includes continuations
no. 13 to 18. This thirteenth continuation
has a large folding plan of Ebenezer,
showing the Savannah River at the bottom,
with a ship in it, and it was published by Seutter
in Augsburg, with a large map of the coast.
The set is rare, and the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>
(iii. no. 541) gives a collation, and adds that
“only after many years’ seeking and the purchase
of several imperfect copies” was its set
completed. Harvard College library has a set
which belonged to Ebeling. (Turell’s <i>Life of
Colman</i>, 152.) Urlsperger was a correspondent
of Benjamin Colman, of Boston. Calvary, of
Berlin, had for sale in 1885 the correspondence
of Samuel Urlsperger with Fresenius, 1738-56
(29 letters), held at 100 marks.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is a supplemental work in four volumes,
printed at Augsburg in 1754-60, bringing
the journal down to 1760, <i>Americanisches Ackerwerk

library, and contains the mezzotint portrait
of Bolzius, the senior minister of Ebenezer,
which is engraved on wood in Gay’s <i>Pop. Hist.
of the U. S.</i>, iii. 155. Harvard College library
has also a part of the journal, with the same
title (Augsburg, 1760), which seems to belong
chronologically after the third part. (Cf. <i>Brinley

says of this book: “Within a volume of only
one hundred and twelve pages is compressed
a masterly statement of the author’s alleged
grievances at the hands of Oglethorpe. The
book gives a detailed and even documentary
account of the rise of the colony, and its quick
immersion in suffering and disaster, through
Oglethorpe’s selfishness, greed, despotism, and
fanatic pursuit of social chimeras.... Whatever
may be the truth or the justice of this book,
it is abundantly interesting, and if any one has
chanced to find the prevailing rumor of Oglethorpe
somewhat nauseating in its sweetness,
he may here easily allay their unpleasant effect.
Certainly as a polemic it is one of the most
expert pieces of writing to be met with in our
early literature. It never blusters or scolds.
It is always cool, poised, polite, and merciless.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

[The lives of Wesley as touching this early
experience of his life, as well as illustrating a
moral revolution, which took within its range all
the English colonies during the period of the
present volume, may properly be characterized
here:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">The introduction to Rigg’s <i>Living Wesley</i> is
devoted to a criticism of the different accounts
of John Wesley, and the student will find further
bibliographical help in a paper on “Wesley
and his biographers,” by W. C. Hoyt in the
<i>Methodist Quarterly</i>, vol. viii.; in the article in
Allibone’s <i>Dict. of Authors</i>; in Decanver’s
[Cavender <i>pseud.</i>] list of books, written in refutation
of Methodism; and in the list of authorities
given by Southey in his <i>Life of Wesley</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Wesley left three literary executors,&mdash;Coke,
Moore, and Whitehead, his physician; and his
journals and papers were put into the hands of
the last named. Coke and Moore, however,
acting independently, were the first to publish
a hasty memoir, and Whitehead followed in
1793-96; but his proved to be the work of a
theological partisan. A memoir by Hampton
was ready when Wesley died, but it turned out
to be very meagre.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Next came the life by Southey in 1820. He
had no sources of information beyond the printed
material open to all; but he had literary skill to
make the most of it, and appreciation enough
of his subject to elevate Wesley’s standing in
the opinion of such as were outside of his communion.
He accordingly made an account of a
great moral revolution, which has been by no
means superseded in popular usefulness.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Now followed a number of lives intended to
correct the representations of previous biographers,
and in some cases to offer views more satisfactory
to the Methodists themselves. Moore,
in 1824, found something to correct in the accounts
of both Whitehead and Southey. Watson,
in 1831, aimed to displace what Southey
had said unsatisfactory to the sect, and to correct
Southey’s chronological order; but he made
his narrative slight and incomplete. Southey
was, however, chiefly relied upon by Mrs. Oliphant
in her sketch, first in <i>Blackwood’s Mag.</i>,
Oct., 1868, and later in her <i>Hist. Sketches of the
Reign of George II.</i>; but while Dr. Rigg acknowledges
it to be clever, he calls it full of
misconceptions. Mrs. Julia Wedgwood, in her
<i>John Wesley and the Evangelical Reaction of
the Eighteenth Century</i> (London, 1870), relied
so much on Southey, as the Methodists say,
that she neglected later information; but she so
far accorded with the general estimation of Wesley
in the denomination as to reject Southey’s
theory of his ambition.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the general histories of English Methodism,
Wesley necessarily plays a conspicuous
part, and their authors are among the most important
of his biographers. The first volume
of George Smith’s history was in effect a life of
Wesley, though somewhat incomplete as such;
but in Abel Stevens’s opening volumes the story
is told more completely and with graphic skill.
There is an excellent account of these days in
chapter 19 of Earl Stanhope’s <i>History of England</i>,
and a careful summary is given in the
fourth volume of the <i>Pictorial History of England</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The relations which Wesley sustained throughout
to the Established Church have been discussed
in the <i>London Quarterly Review</i> by the
Rev. W. Arthur, and by Dr. James H. Rigg, the
contribution by the latter being subsequently
enlarged in a separate book, <i>The relations of
John Wesley and of Wesleyan Methodism to the
Church of England, investigated and determined</i>.
2d edition, revised and enlarged. London, 1871.
See also <i>British Quarterly Review</i>, Oct., 1871,
and the <i>Contemp. Review</i>, vol. xxviii. Curteis,
in his Bampton lectures, goes over the ground
also. Urlin, <i>John Wesley’s place in Church History</i>
(1871), prominently claimed that Wesley
was a revivalist in the church, and not a dissenter,
and aimed to add to our previous knowledge.
A Catholic view of him is given by Dr.
J. G. Shea in the <i>Amer. Cath. Quart. Rev.</i>, vii.
p. 1.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The most extensive narrative, considering
Wesley in all his relations, private as well as
public, the result of seventeen years’ labor, with
the advantage of much new material, is the <i>Life
and Times of Wesley</i>, by Tyerman. It is, however,
far too voluminous for the general reader.
He is not blind to Wesley’s faults, and some
Methodists say he is not in sufficient sympathy
with the reformer to do him justice.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Those who wish compacter estimates of the
man, with only narrative enough to illustrate
them, will find such in Taylor’s <i>Wesley and
Methodism</i>, where the philosophy of the movement
is discussed; in Rigg’s <i>Living Wesley</i>,
which is a condensed generalization of his life,
not without some new matter; and in Dr. Hamilton’s
article in the <i>North British Review</i>, which
was kindly in tone, but not wholly satisfactory to

[Whitefield’s labors in Georgia are summarized
in Tyerman’s <i>Life of Whitefield</i>, London,
1876, with references; and other references
are in Poole’s <i>Index to Periodical Lit.</i>, p. 1406.
Bishop Perry, in his <i>Hist. of the American Episcopal
Church</i>, gives the bibliography of Whitefield’s
Journals, and a chapter on “The Wesleys
and George Whitefield in Georgia.” An account
by Bishop Beckwith of the Orphan House is
contained in the same work.
Foremost among the opponents of Whitefield
was Alexander Garden, an Episcopal clergyman
in Charleston, who lived in the colony from 1720
to his death in 1756. As the Commissary of the
Bishop of London, the constructive ecclesiastical
head of the colonies, he brought much power to
aid his pronounced opinions, and he prosecuted
Whitefield with vigor both in the ecclesiastical
court and in the desk. In 1743 Garden reviewed
his course in a letter [<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i>, xxiv. 117] in which he says: “Bad also is
the present state of the poor Orphan House in
Georgia,&mdash;that land of lies, and from which we
have no truth but what they can neither disguise
nor conceal. The whole Colony is accounted
here one great lie, from the beginning to this
day; and the Orphan House, you know, is a part
of the whole,&mdash;a scandalous bubble.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.]</span></p>

We encounter Gyles frequently as commander of posts in the eastern country. He lived latterly at Roxbury,
Mass., and published at Boston, in 1736, <i>Memoirs of the odd adventures, strange deliverances, etc., in
the captivity of John Gyles, Esq., Commander of the garrison on St. George’s River</i>. This book is of great
rarity. There is a copy in Harvard College library [5315.14] and a defective one in the Mass. Hist. Soc.
library (<i>Catalogue</i>, p. 553). One is noted in S. G. Drake’s <i>Sale Catalogue</i>, 1845, which seems also to have
been imperfect. Drake in reprinting the book in his <i>Tragedies of the Wilderness</i>, Boston, 1846 (p. 73),
altered the text throughout. It was perhaps Drake’s copy which is noted in the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, i. no. 476,
selling for $37. It was again reprinted in Cincinnati, by William Dodge, in 1869, but he followed Drake’s disordered
text. (Cf. Carter-Brown, iii. no. 547; <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, ii. 336; Church, <i>Entertaining Passages</i>,

These tracts are: <i>A Memorial of the Present Deplorable State of New England, with the many disadvantages
it lyes under by the mall-administration of their present Governor, Joseph Dudley, Esq., and his
son Paul ... to which is added a faithful but melancholy account of several barbarities by the French
and Indians in the east and west parts of New England, Printed in the year 1707, and sold ... in Boston</i>.
Two things seem clear: that Cotton Mather incited, perhaps wrote, this tract, and that the printing was done
in London. It is not known that there is a copy in this country, and the reprint was made from one in the
British Museum.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Dudley or some friend rejoined in the second tract, not without violent recriminations upon Mather: <i>A
modest enquiry into the grounds and occasions of a late pamphlet intituled a Memorial, etc. By a disinterested
hand</i>. London, 1707. (Carter-Brown, iii. no. 99; Murphy, i. 327.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">The third tract touches particularly the present expedition: <i>The Deplorable State of New England, by
reason of a covetous and treacherous Governor and pusillanimous Counsellors, ... to which is added an
account of the shameful miscarriage of the late expedition against Port Royal</i>. London, 1708. (Harv. Coll.
library, 10396.80; and Carter-Brown, iii. no. 115.) This tract was reprinted in Boston in 1720. <i>The North
Amer. Rev.</i> (iii. 305) says that this pamphlet was thought to have been written by the Rev. John Higginson, of
Salem, at the age of ninety-two; but the “A. H.” of the preface is probably Alexander Holmes. (Sabin, v.
19,639.) Palfrey (iv. 304, etc.) thinks that its smartness and pedantry indicate rather Cotton Mather or

The Boston Public Library has a Rouen edition of 1708. The Carter-Brown (iii. 109, 137) has both editions, as
has Mr. Barlow (<i>Rough List</i>, nos. 784, 789, 790). The full title of the Rouen edition is: <i>Relation du voyage
du Port Royal de l’Acadie ou de la Nouvelle France, dans laquelle on voit un détail des divers mouvements
de la mer dans une traversée de long cours; la description du Païs, les occupations des François qui y
sont établis, les manières des différentes nations sauvages, leurs superstitions et leurs chasses, avec une dissertation
exacte sur le Castor. Ensuite de la relation, on y a ajouté le détail d’un combat donné entre
les François et les Acadiens contre les Anglois</i>.</p>

Vetch had as early as 1701 been engaged in traffic up the St. Lawrence. Cf. <i>Journal of the voyage of the
sloop Mary from Quebec, 1701, with introduction and notes by E. B. O’Callaghan</i>, Albany, 1866. Through
this and other adventures he had acquired a knowledge of the river; and in pursuance of such traffic he had
gained some enmity, and had at one time been fined £200 for trading with the French. It was in 1706 that
William Rouse, Samuel Vetch, John Borland, and others were arrested on this charge. (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>,
xviii. 240.)</p>

<p class="pfc4">Major Livingstone, accompanied by the younger Castine, was soon sent by way of the Penobscot
to Quebec to acquaint Vaudreuil, the French governor,
on behalf of both Nicholson and Subercase, with the capture of
Port Royal, and to demand the discontinuance of the Indian ravages.
Livingstone’s journal is, or was, in the possession of the Chicago
Historical Society, when William Barry (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
Oct., 1861, p. 230) communicated an account of it, showing how
the manuscript had probably been entrusted to Governor Gurdon
Saltonstall, and had descended in his family. (<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, v. 257.) Cf. Palfrey, iv. 278; Williamson,
ii. 60; a paper on the Baron de St. Castin, by Noah Brooks, in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, May, 1883; Charlevoix
(Shea’s), v. 233. Penhallow seems to have had Livingstone’s journal; Hutchinson (ii. 168) certainly
had it. Cf. account in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, ix. 854. Castine’s instructions are in <i>Collection de Manuscrits</i>, ii.
p. 534.

1725, where he complains of the treachery of the commander of an English vessel. (<i>N. E. Hist. and Gen.

Penhallow, 90; Vaudreuil and Begon in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, ix. 933. Dr. Shea (<i>Charlevoix</i>, v. 278) thinks
some rude translations of letters of Rasle (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, xviii. 245, 266), alleged to have been found
at Norridgewock, are suspicious. Cf. Palfrey, iv. 422, 423; Farmer and Moore’s <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, ii. 108. A distinct
asseveration of the incitement of the French authorities and their priests is in the <i>Observations on the
late and present conduct of the French</i>, published by Dr. Clarke in Boston in 1755, quoted by Franklin in his
Canada pamphlet (1760), in <i>Works</i>, iv. p. 7. Cf. on the French side a “Mémoire sur l’entreprise que les
Anglois de Baston font sur les terres des Abenakis sauvages alliés des François” in <i>Collection de manuscrits</i>
(Quebec, 1882), ii. p. 68, where are various letters which passed between Vaudreuil and Shute.</p>

On the French side we have Charlevoix (Shea’s ed., v. 280), and the <i>Lettres Edifiantes</i>, sub anno 1722-1724
(cf. Vol. IV. p. 316), with the <i>Nouvelles des Missions; Missions de l’Amérique</i>, 1702-43, Paris, 1827,
both giving Father de la Chasse’s letter, dated Quebec, Oct. 29, 1724, which is also given in English by Kip,
p. 69. Cf. <i>Les Jésuites Martyrs du Canada</i>, Montreal, 1877, p. 243. There is a letter of Vaudreuil in <i>N. Y.
Col. Doc.</i>, ix. 936. These and on the English side the letters of Rasle, edited by Thaddeus Mason Harris, in
the <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. xviii., are the chief authorities; but Harmon’s journal and a statement by Moulton
were used by Hutchinson (ii. 281). Upon this material the <i>Life of Rasle</i>, by Convers Francis in Sparks’s
<i>Amer. Biog.</i>, vol. 17, and that in <i>Die Katholisches Kirche in dem Vereinigten Staten</i> (Regensburg, 1864) are
based.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The estimates of Rasle’s character are as diverse as the Romish and Protestant faiths can make them. The
times permitted and engendered inhumanity and perfidy. There is no sentimentality to be lost over Rasle or
his adversaries. Cf. Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>, v. 280; Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>, iv. 438; Hannay, <i>Acadia</i>, 320.
Hutchinson (ii. 238) says the English classed him “among the most infamous villains,” while the French
ranked him with “saints and heroes.”</p>

A memorandum of Dr. Belknap, printed in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the Mass. Hist. Soc. (x. p. 313) shows as
being in the cabinet of that society in 1792 the following sets of papers: Correspondence between Shirley and
Wentworth, 1742-1753; between Shirley and Pepperrell, 1745-1746; between Pepperrell and Warren, 1745;
between these last and the British ministry, 1745-1747; and between Pepperrell and persons of distinction
throughout America, 1745-1747. These papers as now arranged cover the preparations for the siege, as well
as its progress, and the events immediately succeeding. Pepperrell’s letters are mostly drafts, in his own hand.
The instructions from Shirley are dated Mar. 19 (p. 13). We find here “A register of all the Commissions”
(p. 26); the notification of the capitulation, June 20 (p. 63). There are letters of Benning Wentworth, Com.
Warren, Gen. Waldo, John Gorham, John Bradstreet, Arthur Noble, William Vaughan, John Rous, Robert
Auchmuty, Ammi R. Cutter, N. Sparhawk, etc. There are also various letters of Benj. Colman, who from
his relations to Pepperrell took great interest in the movement. (Cf. the Colman papers, 1697-1747, presented
to the same society in 1793.) The editor of <i>N. H. Prov. Papers</i>, vol. v., prints various papers as from the
“Belknap Papers” in the N. H. Hist. Society library. Cf. <i>Belknap Papers</i> (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>), i. 120.</p>

It contains manuscript books, bound together, which were in part the gift of the Hon. Daniel Sargent, and
in part came from the heirs of Dr. Belknap. These books contain copies of the leading official papers of the
expedition and capitulation, the records of the councils of war from Apr. 5, 1745, at Canso, to May 16, 1746, at
Louisbourg, the letters of Pepperrell, Shirley, Warren, and others between Mar. 27, 1745, and May 30, 1746;
records of consultation on board the “Superbe,” Warren’s flag-ship; with various other letters of Warren;
several narratives and journals of the siege and later transactions at Louisbourg, some of them bearing interlineations
and erasures as if original drafts; and papers respecting pilots and deserters. The writer of the
diaries and narrative is given in one case only, that of an artillerist who records events between May 17 and

Of the vessels shown in this view the “Massachusetts” frigate (no. 20) was under the command of Edward
Tyng, the senior of the provincial naval officers, who,
acting under Shirley’s commission, had found a merchantman
on the stocks, which under Tyng’s direction was converted
into this cruiser of 24 guns. (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, x.
181; Williamson’s <i>Maine</i>, ii. 223; Preble’s “Notes on
Early Ship-Building,” in <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
Oct., 1871, p. 363; Alden’s <i>Epitaphs</i>, ii. 328; Drake’s <i>Five
Years’ War</i>, 246.) Tyng had been a successful officer.
The previous year he had captured a French privateer which,
sailing from Louisbourg, had infested the bay, and on May 24, 1744, the town of Boston had thanked him.

<p class="pfc4">The next ranking provincial naval officer was Capt. John Rous, or Rouse, who commanded the “Shirley
Galley,” a snow, or two-masted vessel, of 24 guns. Rouse had the previous year, in a Boston privateer, spread
some consternation among the French fishing-fleet on the Grand Banks. It was this provincial craft and the
royal ship the “Mermaid,” of 40 guns, Capt. James Douglas, which captured the French man-of-war the
“Vigilant,” 64 guns (no. 15), as she was approaching the coast. (Drake’s <i>Five Years’ War</i>, App. C.) Douglas
was transferred to the captured ship, and a requisition was made upon the colonies to furnish a crew to
man her. (Corresp., etc., in <i>R. I. Col. Rec.</i>, v.) Capt. William Montague was put in command of the “Mermaid,”
and after the surrender she sailed, June 22, for England with despatches, arriving July 20. Duplicate
despatches were sent by Rouse in the “Shirley Galley,” which sailed July 4. The British government took
the “Shirley Galley” into their service and commissioned Rouse as a royal post-captain. This vessel disappears
from sight after 1749, when Rouse is found in command of a vessel in the fleet which brought Cornwallis
to Chebucto (Halifax). At the time of Rouse’s death at Portsmouth, Apr. 3, 1760, he was in command
of the “Sutherland,” 50 guns. (Charnock, <i>Biographia Navalis</i>; Isaac J. Greenwood’s “First American
built vessels in the British navy,” in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, Oct., 1866, p. 323. There are notes
on Rouse, with references, in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 156, and <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 59; cf. also Drake’s <i>Five Years’
French and Indian War</i>, p. 240, and <i>Nova Scotia Docs.</i>, ed. by Akins, p. 225.) Preble (<i>N. E. H. and Gen.
Reg.</i>, 1868, p. 396) collates contemporary authorities for a precise description of a “galley.” Such a ship was
usually a “snow,” as the largest two-masted vessels were often called, and would seem to have carried all her
guns on a continuous deck, without the higher tiers at the ends, which was customary with frigates built low
only at the waist.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The “Cæsar,” of 20 guns, was commanded by Capt. Snelling, the third ranking provincial officer.</p>

“A train of favorable, unforeseen, and even astonishing events facilitated the conquest,” says Amos Adams
in his <i>Concise Hist. of New England</i>, etc. Palfrey in his review of Mahon speaks of it as “one of the wildest
undertakings ever projected by sane people.” Whatever the fortuitous character of the conquest, there was an
attempt made in England to give the chief credit of it to Warren, who never landed a marine during its progress.</p>

Winslow’s instructions, dated Halifax, Aug. 11, 1755, are printed in Akins’s <i>Selections</i>, etc., 271. It has

in this decision. Letters between Lawrence and the Board of Trade (Oct. 18, 1755, etc.) indicate that the
hope of such succession to lands was entertained after the event; but it was several years before the hope had
fruition.</p>

in vol. iii. of the <i>Nova Scotia Hist. Soc. Collections</i>, beginning with a letter from Grand Pré, Aug. 22, 1755.
The second volume (Feb.-Aug., 1756) has a certificate that it is, “to the best of my skill and judgment, a
true record of original papers committed to my care for that purpose.” This is signed “Henry Leddel,
Secretary to General Winslow.” The third volume (Aug.-Dec., 1756) is similarly certified. There is in the
Mass. Hist. Soc. another collection of Winslow’s papers (cf. <i>Proc.</i>, iii. 92) covering 1737-1766, being mostly of
a routine military character.</p>

Compare the enumeration of MSS. on Acadia, as indexed in the <i>Catalogue of the Library of Parliament</i>,
Toronto, 1858, p. 1451. There are preserved in the office of the registrar of the Province of Quebec
ten volumes of MS. copies of documents relating to the history of Canada, covering many pertaining to Acadia.
A list of their contents was printed in 1883, entitled <i>Réponse à un ordre de la chambre, demandant
copie de la liste des documents se rapportant à l’histoire du Canada, copiés et conservés au département
du régistraire de la Province de Québec</i>. <i>J. Blanchet, Secrétaire.</i> Cf. “Evangeline and the Archives

He does intimate, in some later published letters, that a taking of hostages might perhaps have sufficed.
The controversy of which these letters are a part began with the anticipatory publication by Mr. Parkman of
his chapter on the Acadians in <i>Harper’s Monthly</i>, Nov., 1884. This drew out from Mr. Philip H. Smith a
paper in the <i>Nation</i>, Oct. 30, 1884, in which incautiously, and depending on Haliburton, he charged the
English with rifling their archives to rid them of the proofs of the atrocity of the deportation. Parkman exposed
his error, in the same journal, Nov. 6, 1884, and also in the <i>N. Y. Evening Post</i>, Jan. 20, 1885, and
<i>Boston Evening Transcript</i>, Jan. 22. Smith transferred his challenge to the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i> of
Feb. 11, 1885, making a good point in quoting the Philadelphia Memorial of the Acadians, which affirmed that
papers which could show their innocence had been taken from them; but he unwisely claimed for the exiles
the literary skill of that memorial, which seems to have been prepared by some of their Huguenot friends in
Philadelphia. A few more letters appeared in the same journal from Parkman, Akins, and Smith, but added
nothing but iteration to the question. (Cf. <i>Transcript</i>, Feb. 25, by Parkman; March 19 by Akins; March
23, April 3, by Smith.)</p>

There are large extracts from these Archives in the <i>Winslow Papers</i> (Mass. Hist. Soc.). <i>North Amer.

In Bailey’s <i>Andover</i> (p. 297) there is some account of those sent to that town, and a copy of a petition
(<i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxiii. 49) from those in Andover and adjacent towns to the General Court, urging that
their children should not be bound out to service. Cf. also Aaron Hobart’s <i>Abington</i>, App. F., and “Lancaster

Jasper Mauduit’s letter to the House of Representatives, relating to a reimbursement of the expense of
supporting the French neutrals, 1763. <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vi. 189. Among the Bernard Papers (<i>Sparks
MSS.</i>), ii. 279, is a letter from Bernard to Capt. Brookes, dated Castle William, Sept. 26, 1762, forbidding the
landing of Acadians from his “transports.” There is also in <i>Ibid.</i>, ii. 83, a letter of Gov. Bernard, July 20,
1763, in which he speaks of a proposition which had been made to the French neutrals then in the province,
to go to France on invitation of the French government. “Many of these people,” he adds, “are industrious,
and would, I believe, prefer this country and become subjects of Great Britain in earnest, if they were assured
of liberty of conscience.” The governor accordingly asks instructions from the Lords of Trade. The number
of such people intending to go was, as he says, 1,019 in all, which he considers very near if not quite the whole
number in the province. Bernard expressed a hope that he could induce them to settle rather at Miramichi,
as he had formed a high opinion of their industry and frugality (p. 86). When some of them wished to migrate
to Saint Pierre, the small island near the St. Lawrence Gulf, then lately confirmed to France, the governor
and council tried to persuade them to remain.</p>

The cartography of these three books deserves discrimination. In <i>De Nieuwe en onbekende Weereld</i> of
Montanus (Amsterdam, 1670-71) the map of America, “per Gerardum a Schagen,” represents the great lakes
beyond Ontario merged into one. The German version, <i>Die unbekante Neue Welt</i>, of Olfert Dapper has the
same map, newly engraved, and marked “per Jacobum Meursium.” Ogilby’s English version, <i>America, being
an accurate description of the New World</i> (London, 1670), though using for the most part the plates of Montanus,
has a wholly different map of America, “per Johannem Ogiluium.” This volume has an extra map of
the Chesapeake, in addition to the Montanus one, beside English maps of Jamaica and Barbadoes, not in Montanus.
These maps are repeated in the second edition, which is made up of the same sheets, to which an appendix
is added, and a new title, reading, <i>America, being the latest and most accurate description of the new
world</i>. It will be remembered that Pope, in the <i>Dunciad</i> (i. 141), mocked at Ogilby for his ponderous folio,&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Here swells the shelf with Ogilby the Great.”</p>

This memorial was printed by Bradford in Philadelphia about 1721. Hildeburn’s <i>Century of Printing</i>,
no. 170. There was a claim upon the Kennebec, arising from certain early grants to Plymouth Colony, and in
elucidation of such claims <i>A patent for Plymouth in New England, to which is annexed extracts from the
Records of the Colony, etc.</i>, was printed in Boston in 1751. There is a copy among the <i>Belknap Papers</i>, in
the Mass. Hist. Soc. (61, c. 105, etc.), where will be found a printed sheet of extracts from deeds, to which is
annexed an engraved plan of the coast of Maine between Cape Elizabeth and Pemaquid, and of the Kennebec
valley up to Norridgewock, which is called <i>A true copy of an ancient plan of E. Hutchinson’s, Esq<sup>r</sup>.,
from Jos. Heath, in 1719, and Phin<sup>s</sup>. Jones’ Survey in 1751, and from John North’s late survey in 1752</i>.
<i>Attest, Thomas Johnston</i>. The Belknap copy has annotations in the handwriting of Thomas Prince, and
with it is a tract called <i>Remarks on the plan and extracts of deeds lately published by the proprietors of

The articles of the treaty of Utrecht touching the American possessions of England are cited and commented
upon in William Bollan’s <i>Importance and Advantage of Cape Breton</i>, etc. (London, 1746.) The
diplomacy of the treaty of Utrecht can be followed in the <i>Miscellaneous State Papers</i>, 1501-1726, in two volumes,
usually cited by the name of the editor, as the <i>Hardwicke Papers</i>. Cf. also <i>Actes, mémoires et autres
pièces authentiques concernant la paix d’Utrecht, depuis l’année 1706 jusqu’à présent</i>. Utrecht, 1712-15,
6 vols. J. W. Gerard’s <i>Peace of Utrecht, a historical review of the great treaty of 1713-14, and of the principal
events of the war of the Spanish succession</i> (New York, etc., 1885) has very little (p. 286) about the
American aspects of the treaty.</p>

The maps of Huske and Mitchell (1755), showing the claims of the French and English throughout the
continent, are noted on a previous page (<i>ante</i>, p. 84), and that of Huske is there sketched. In a <i>New and
Complete Hist. of the Brit. Empire in America</i>, London, 1756, etc., are maps of “Newfoundland and Nova
Scotia,” and of “New England and parts adjacent,” showing the French claim as extending to the line of
the Kennebec, and following the water-shed between the St. Lawrence and the Atlantic.</p>

This Indian confederacy of New York called
themselves Hodenosaunee (variously spelled);
the French styled them Iroquois; the Dutch,
Maquas; the English, the Five Nations; the
Delawares, the Menwe, which last the Pennsylvanians
converted into Mingoes, later applied in
turn to the Senecas in Ohio. Dr. Shea, in his
notes to Lossing’s ed. of Washington’s diaries,
says: “The Mengwe, Minquas, or Mingoes were
properly the Andastes or Gandastogues, the Indians
of Conestoga, on the Susquehanna, known
by the former name to the Algonquins and their
allies, the Dutch and Swedes; the Marylanders
knew them as the Susquehannas. Upon their
reduction by the Five Nations, in 1672, the Andastes
were to a great extent mingled with their
conquerors, and a party removing to the Ohio,
commonly called Mingoes, was thus made up of
Iroquois and Mingoes. Many treat Mingo as
synonymous with Mohawk or Iroquois, but erroneously.”</p>

This fort had been built in 1739, and called
Fort St. Frederick. G. W. Schuyler (<i>Colonial
N. Y.</i>, ii. pp. 113, 114) uses the account of the
adjutant of the French force, probably found in
Canada at the conquest. The fort stood on the
west side of the Hudson, south of Schuylerville,
while Fort Clinton, built in 1746, was on the
east side. (<i>Ibid.</i>, ii. pp. 126, 254.) A plan of
this later fort (1757) is noted in the <i>King’s Maps</i>

The terms of the capitulation, as rendered
by Villiers, had a reference to the “assassinat”
of Jumonville, which a Dutchman, Van Braam,
who acted as interpreter, concealed from Washington
by translating the words “death of Jumonville.”

The annexed plan of the field is from a contemporary
MS. in Harvard College library. See
<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xvii. p. 118 (1879).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Parkman (<i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>, i. 214) reproduces
two plans of the fight: one representing
the disposition of the line of march at the moment
of attack; the other, the situation when
the British were thrown into confusion and abandoned
their guns. The originals of these plans
accompany a letter of Shirley to Robinson, Nov.
5, 1755, and are preserved in the Public Record
Office, in the volume<i> America and West Indies</i>,
lxxxii. They were drawn at Shirley’s request by
Patrick Mackellar, chief engineer, who was with
Gage in the advance column. Parkman says:
“They were examined and fully approved by the
chief surviving officers, and they closely correspond
with another plan made by the aide-de-camp
Orme,&mdash;which, however, shows only the
beginning of the affair.” This plan of Orme is
the last in a series of six plans, engraved in
1758 by Jefferys (Thomson, <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, no.
107; Sabin, ii. no. 7,212), and used by him in
his <i>General Topography of North America and
the West Indies</i>, London, 1768. There is a set
of them, also, in the Sparks MSS., in Harvard

Braddock’s remains are said to have been
discovered about 1823 by workmen engaged in
constructing the National Road, at a spot pointed
out by an old man named Fossit, Fausett, or
Faucit, who had been in the provincial ranks in
1755. He claimed to have seen Braddock buried,
and to have fired the bullet which killed him.
The story is not credited by Sargent, who gives
(p. 244) a long examination of the testimony.
(Cf. also <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xi. p. 141.) Lowdermilk
(p. 187) says that it was locally believed; so
does De Hass in his <i>West. Virginia</i>, p. 128. Remains
of a body with bits of military trappings
were found, however, on digging. A story of
Braddock’s sash is told by De Hass, in his <i>W.
Virginia</i>, p. 129. In July, 1841, a large quantity
of shot and shell, buried by the retreating army,
was unearthed near by. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
iii. 231, etc. A picture of his grave was painted
in 1854 by Weber, and is now in the gallery of
the Penna. Hist. Soc. (Cf. its <i>Catal. of Paintings</i>,
no. 66.) It is engraved in Sargent, p. 280.
Cf. Day, <i>Hist. Coll. Penna.</i>, p. 334. Lowdermilk
(pp. 188, 200) gives views of the grave in 1850
and 1877, with some account of its mutations.
Cf. Scharf and Westcott’s <i>Philadelphia</i>, ii. p.
1002. A story obtained some currency that Braddock’s
remains were finally removed to England.

For the rejoicing of Shirley’s enemies, cf.
Barry’s <i>Mass.</i>, ii. 212. Shirley had got an intimation
of the purpose to supersede him as
early as Apr. 16, 1756. (<i>Penna. Archives</i>, ii.
630.) He had some strong friends all the while.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Gov. Livingston undertook to show that the
ill-success of the campaign of 1755 was due
more to jealousies and intrigues than to Shirley’s
incapacity. (<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vii. 159.)
“Except New York,” he adds, “or rather a prevailing
faction here, all the colonies hold Shirley
in very high esteem.” Franklin says: “Shirley,
if continued in place, would have made a much
better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1756,
which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful
to our nation beyond comparison; for though
Shirley was not bred a soldier, he was sensible
and sagacious in himself and attentive to good
advice from others, capable of forming judicious
plans, and quick and active in carrying them
into execution.... Shirley was, I believe, sincerely
glad of being relieved.” <i>Franklin’s Writings</i>
(Sparks’ ed.), i. p. 220-21.</p>

Loudon had to this end held meetings with
the northern governors at Boston in January,
and with the southern governors at Philadelphia
in March, 1757. Loudon’s correspondence at
this time is in the Public Record Office (<i>America
and West Indies</i>, vol. lxxxv.), and is copied
in the Parkman MSS. When Loudon left with
his 91 transports and five men-of-war, he sent
off a despatch-boat to England; and Jenkinson,
on the receipt of the message, wrote to Grenville,
reflecting probably Loudon’s reports, that
“the public seem to be extremely pleased with
the secrecy and spirit of this enterprise.” <i>Grenville
Corresp.</i>, i. 201.</p>

Bancroft and those who follow him, taking
their cue from Smith (<i>Hist. of New York</i>), say
that Loudon “proposed to encamp on Long
Island for the defence of the continent.” Parkman
(ii. p. 2) points out that this is Smith’s perversion
of a statement of Loudon that he should
disembark on that island if head winds prevented
his entering New York bay, when he returned
from Halifax. There seems to have been a current
apprehension of a certain ridiculousness in
all of Loudon’s movements. It induced John
Adams to believe even then that the colonies
could get on better without England than with
her. Cf. the <i>John Adams and Mercy Warren
Letters (Mass. Hist. Soc. Collections)</i>, p. 339.</p>

Plans of the fort and settlement at Schenectady

Abercrombie’s engineer surveyed the French
works from an opposite hill, and pronounced it
practicable to carry them by assault. Stark,
with a better knowledge of such works, demurred;
but his opinions had no weight. A
view of the field of Abercrombie’s defeat is
given in Gay, <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 299.
M. D’Hagues sent to the Marshal de Belle
Isle on account of the situation of Fort Carillon
[Ticonderoga] and its approaches, dated at
the fort, May 1, 1758, which is printed (in translation)
in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 707; and in the
same, p. 720, is another description by M. de
Pont le Roy, French engineer-in-chief.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The condition of the fort at the time of Abercrombie’s
attack in 1758 is well represented by
maps and plans. Cf. the plan of this date in
the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 721; and the French
plan noted in the <i>Catal. of the Library of Parliament</i>
(Toronto, 1858), p. 1621, no. 86. Bonnechose
(<i>Montcalm et le Canada</i>, p. 91) gives a
French plan, “Bataille de Carillon, d’après un
Plan inédit de l’époque.” Jefferys engraved a
<i>Plan of town and fort of Carillon at Tyconderoga,
with the attack made by the British army commanded
by General Abercrombie, 8 July, 1758</i>,
which Jefferys later included in his <i>General
Topog. of North America and the West Indies</i>,
London, 1768, no. 38. Martin, <i>De Montcalm en
Canada</i>, p. 128, follows Jefferys’ draft. Hough
in his edition of <i>Pouchot</i>, p. 108, gives the plan
of the attack as it appeared in Mante’s <i>Hist. of
the Late War</i>, London, 1772, p. 144; and from
this it is reproduced in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x.
726.</p>

When Pitt heard of Abercrombie’s defeat
he wrote to Grenville: “I own this news has

Speaking of Canada, John Fiske (<i>Amer.
Polit. Ideas</i>, p. 55) says of the effect of the
bureaucracy which governed it that it “was absolute
paralysis, political and social,” and that in
the war-struggle of the eighteenth century “the
result for the French power in America was instant
and irretrievable annihilation. The town
meeting pitted against bureaucracy was like a
Titan overthrowing a cripple;” but he forgets
the history of that overthrow, its long-drawn-out
warfare, the part that the vastly superior
population and the interior lines and seaboard
bases of supplies for the English played in the
contest to intensify their power, and the jealousies
and independence of the colonies themselves,
which so long enabled the French to survive.
Even as regards the results of the campaign
of 1759, the suddenness had little of the
inevitable in it, when we consider the leisurely
campaign of Amherst, and the mere chance of
Wolfe surmounting the path at the cove. It
took the successes of these last campaigns to
produce the fruits of conquest, even at the end
of a long conflict.</p>

Montgomery, nearly twenty years later, with
a similar task before him, said, “Wolfe’s success
was a lucky hit, or rather a series of such
hits; all sober and scientific calculations of war
were against him until Montcalm gave up the
advantage of his fortress.” (Force’s <i>Am. Archives</i>,
iii. 1,638.)</p>

Sabine collates the various accounts of
Wolfe’s death, believing that Knox’s is the most
trustworthy. The <i>Memoirs of Donald Macleod</i>
(London), an old sergeant of the Highlanders,
says that Wolfe was carried from the field in
Macleod’s plaid. There is an account of his
pistols and sash in the <i>Canadian Antiquarian</i>,
iv. 31.</p>

Dr. O’Callaghan (<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 400)
threw some doubt on this statement, but it seems
to be well established by contemporary record
(Parkman, ii. 441). The remains of Montcalm
were disturbed in digging another grave in 1833,
but little was found except the skull, which is
still shown in the convent. (Miles’s <i>Canada</i>, p.
415.) See the view in <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, xviii.

<p class="pfc4">Dalhousie, when governor, caused a monument,
inscribed with the names of both Wolfe
and Montcalm, to be erected in the town. (Harper’s
Mag., xviii. 188; <i>Canadian Antiquarian</i>, vi.
176.) A monument near the spot where Wolfe
was struck down, and inscribed, “Here Wolfe
died victorious,” fell into a decay, which relic-seekers
had helped to increase (see a view of it
in its dilapidated condition in Lossing’s <i>Field-Book
of the Revolution</i>, i. p. 189), and was in 1849
replaced by a monument surmounted with a helmet
and sword, which is now seen by visitors,
and, beside repeating the inscription on the old
one, bears this legend: “This pillar was erected
by the British army in Canada, A. D. 1849, ... to
replace that erected ... in 1832, which was broken
and defaced, and is deposited beneath.” (See
views in <i>Harper’s Mag.</i>, xviii. p. 183.) A view of
it from a sketch made in 1851 is annexed. An account
of these memorials, with their inscriptions,
is given in Martin’s <i>De Montcalm en Canada</i>, p.
211, with the correspondence which passed between
Pitt and the secretary of the French Academy
respecting an inscription which the army of
Montcalm desired to place over his grave in
Quebec. (Cf. Martin, p. 216; Bonnechose, <i>Montcalm
et Canada</i>, App.; Warburton’s Conquest
of Canada, ii., App.; and Watson’s <i>County of
Essex</i>, p. 490.)</p>

There is doubt where Rogers encamped,&mdash;the
river “Chogage.” Parkman in the original
edition of his <i>Pontiac</i> (1851, p. 147) called it the
site of Cleveland; but he avoids the question in
his revised edition (i. p. 165). Bancroft (orig. ed.,
iv. 361) and Stone, <i>Johnson</i> (ii. 132), have notes
on the subject. Cf. also Chas. Whittlesey’s

Here we find Bellomont’s correspondence
(1698) with the French governor as to the relations
of the Five Nations to the English, pp. 682,
690. Cf. also <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, iv. 367, 420;
Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>, v. 82; a tract, <i>Propositions
made by the Five Nations of Indians ... to Bellomont
in Albany, 20th of July, 1698</i> (N. Y.,
1698), containing the doings of Bellomont and his
council on Indian affairs up to Aug. 20, 1698.
(Brinley, ii. 3,400.) The same vol. of <i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i> (ix.) gives beside a memoir (p. 701; also in
<i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., vi. 45) on the encroachments
of the English; conferences with the Indians
at Detroit (p. 704) and elsewhere in 1700;
the ratification of the treaty of peace at Montreal,
Aug. 4, 1701 (p. 722); conferences of Vaudreuil
with the Five Nations in 1703 and 1705
(pp. 746, 767); the scheme of seizing Niagara,
1706 (p. 773); Sieur d’Aigrement’s instructions
and report on the Western posts (p. 805); a survey
(p. 917) of English invasion of French territory
(1680-1723); a memoir (p. 840) on the
condition of Canada (1709),&mdash;not to name
others.</p>
<p class="pfc4">For the period covered by the survey of this
present chapter, these <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i> give
from the London archives papers 1693-1706
(vol. iv.), 1707-1733 (vol. v.), 1734-1755 (vol.
vi.), 1756-1767 (vol. vii.); and from the Paris
archives, 1631-1744 (vol. ix.), 1745-1778 (vol.
x.). The index to the whole is in vol. xi. See
Vol. IV. pp. 409, 410.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There has been a recent treatment of the relations
of the English with the Indians in Geo.
W. Schuyler’s <i>Colonial New York</i>, in which
Philip Schuyler is a central figure, during the
latter end of the seventeenth and for the first
quarter of the eighteenth century. The book
touches the conferences in Bellomont’s and Nanfan’s
time. Colden, who was inimical to Schuyler,
took exception to some statements in Smith’s
<i>New York</i> respecting him, and Colden’s letters
were printed by the N. Y. Hist. Society in 1868.</p>

The biography of Cadillac has been best
traced in Silas Farmer’s <i>Detroit</i>, p. 326. He extended
his inquiries among the records of France,
and (p. 17) enumerates the grants to him about
the straits. Cf. T. P. Bédard on Cadillac in <i>Revue
Canadienne</i>, new ser., ii. 683; and a paper
on his marriage in <i>Ibid.</i>, iii. 104; and others by
Rameau, in <i>Ibid.</i>, xiii. 403. The municipality of
Castelsarrasin in France presented to the city of
Detroit a view of the old Carmelite church&mdash;now
a prison&mdash;where Cadillac is buried. An
engraving of it is given by Farmer. Julius Melchers,
a Detroit sculptor, has made a statue of
the founder, of which there is an engraving in
Robert E. Roberts’ <i>City of the Straits</i>, Detroit,
1884, p. 14.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Farmer (p. 221) gives a description of Fort
Pontchartrain as built by Cadillac, and (p. 33)
a map of 1796, defining its position in respect
to the modern city. Cf. also Roberts’ <i>City of the
Straits</i>, p. 40. The oldest plan of Detroit is
dated 1749, and is reproduced by Farmer (p. 32).
Of the oldest house in Detroit, the Moran house,
there are views in Farmer (p. 372) and Roberts
(p. 50), who respectively assign its building to
1734 and 1750.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the later histories, not already mentioned,
reference may be made to Charlevoix
(Shea’s ed., vol. v. 154); E. Rameau’s <i>Notes historiques

prononcée à Windsor sur le Détroit, comté
d’Essex, C. W., 1<sup>er</sup> avril, 1861</i>, Montréal, 1861;
Rufus Blanchard’s <i>Discovery and Conquests of
the Northwest</i>, Chicago, 1880; and Marie Caroline
Watson Hamlin’s <i>Legends of le Détroit, Illus.
by Isabella Stewart</i>, Detroit, 1884. These
legends, covering the years 1679-1815, relate to
Detroit and its vicinity. On p. 263, etc., are given
genealogical notes about the early French families
resident there. A brief sketch of the early
history of Detroit by C. I. Walker, as deposited
beneath the corner-stone of the new City Hall in
1868, is printed in the <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xv. 132. Cf.

James Maury in 1756, referring to Evans’
map, says, “It is but small, not above half as
large as Fry and Jefferson’s, consequently
crowded. It gives an attentive peruser a clear
idea of the value of the now contested lands and
waters to either of the two competitor princes,
together with a proof, amounting to more than a
probability, that he of the two who shall remain
master of Ohio and the Lakes must in the course
of a few years become sole and absolute lord of
North America.” Maury’s <i>Huguenot Family</i>,
387. T. Pownall’s <i>Topographical description of
such parts of North America as are contained in
the (annexed) map of the British middle colonies,
etc., in North America</i> (London, 1776) contains
Evans’ map, pieced out by Pownall, and it reprints
Evans’ preface (1755), with an additional
preface by Pownall, dated Albemarle Street (London),
Nov. 22, 1775, in which it is said that the
map of 1755 was used by the officers during the
French war, and served every practicable purpose.
He says Evans followed for Virginia Fry
and Jefferson’s map (1751), and that John Henry’s
map of Virginia, published by Jefferys in
1770, enabled him (Pownall) to add little. For
Pennsylvania Evans had been assisted by Mr.
Nicholas Scull, who in 1759 published his map
of Pennsylvania, and for the later edition of 1770
Pownall says he added something. As to New
Jersey, Pownall claims he used the drafts of Alexander,
surveyor-general, and that he has followed
Holland for the boundary line between New Jersey
and New York. Pownall affirms that Holland
disowned a map of New York and New Jersey
which Jefferys published with Holland’s name
attached, though some portions of it followed
surveys made by Holland. What Pownall added
of New England he took from the map in Douglass,
correcting it from drafts in the Board of
Trade office, and following for the coasts the surveys
of Holland or his deputies. Pownall denounces
the “late Thomas Jefferys” for his inaccurate
and untrustworthy pirated edition of the
Evans map, the plate of which fell into the hands
of Sayer, the map publisher, and was used by him
in more than one atlas.</p>

Evans’ map of 1755 is held to embody the
best geographical knowledge of this region,
picked up mainly between 1740 and 1750. The
region about Lake Erie with the positions of the
Indian tribes, is given from this map, in Whittlesey’s

Beauharnois’ despatches about Oswego begin
in 1728 (<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, ix. 1,010). That same
year Walpole addressed a paper on the two posts
to the French government, and with it is found
in the French archives a plan of Oswego, “fait à
Montreal 17 Juillet, 1727, signé De Lery.” The
correspondence of Gov. Burnet and Beauharnois
is in <i>Ibid.</i>, ix. p. 999. The plan just named is
also in the <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, vol. i., in connection
with papers respecting the founding of the post.
Smith (<i>New York</i>, 1814, p. 273) holds that the
French purpose to demolish the works at Oswego
in 1729 caused a reinforcement of the garrison,
which deterred them from the attempt.
Smith says of the original fort there that its situation
had little regard to anything beside the
pleasantness of the prospect. Burnet, the New
York governor, exerted himself to destroy the
trade between Albany and Montreal, and the report
of a committee which he transmitted to the
home government is printed in Smith’s <i>New York</i>
(Albany, 1814 ed., p. 246); but in 1729 the machinations
of those interested in the trade procured
the repeal of the restraining act. (<i>Ibid.</i>, 274;
cf. Smith, vol. ii. (1830) p. 97.) At a late day
(1741) there is an abstract of despatches to the
French minister respecting Oswego in the <i>Penna.
Archives</i> (2d ser., vi. 51), and a paper on the
state of the French and English on Ontario in
1743 is in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vi. 227.</p>

O. H. Marshall on the Niagara frontier, in

(<i>New York</i>, 1814, p. 268) says that “Charlevoix
himself acknowledges that Niagara was a part
of the territory of the Five Nations; yet the
pious Jesuit applauds the French settlement
there, which was so manifest an infraction of the
treaty of Utrecht.”</p>

Of the occupation of Crown Point by the
French, Smith (<i>New York</i>, 1814, p. 279) says:
“Of all the French infractions of the treaty of
Utrecht, none was more palpable than this. The
country belonged to the Six Nations, and the
very spot upon which the fort stands is included
within the patent to Dellius, the Dutch minister
of Albany, granted in 1696.” Again he says (p.
280): “The Massachusetts government foresaw
the dangerous consequences of the French fort
at Crown Point, and Gov. Belcher gave us the
first intimation of it.” It was not till 1749 that
there were reports that the French were beginning
to plant settlers about Crown Point. (<i>Penna.
Archives</i>, ii. 20.) Jefferys published a map showing
the grants made by the French about Lake
Champlain.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The English fort at Crown Point was built
farther from the lake than the earlier French inconsiderable
work. Chas. Carroll (<i>Journal to

ruins at that time,&mdash;-the result of an accidental
fire.</p>

Lord John Russell, in his introduction to
the <i>Bedford Correspondence</i>, i. p. xlviii., says:
“Had the Duke of Bedford been allowed to order
the sailing of the expedition, it is most probable
the conquest of Canada would not have
been reserved for the Seven Years’ War; but
the indecision or timidity of the Duke of Newcastle
delayed and finally broke up the expedition.”
A representation of the Duke of Bedford
and others upon the reduction of Canada, made
March 30, 1746, is in <i>Bedford Corresp.</i>, i. 65.</p>

In addition to the references there given,
note may be taken of a paper on the expedition,
by O. H. Marshall, in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>,
ii. 129 (Mar., 1878), with reference to the original
documents in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 189,
and in the <i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., vi. 63. Cf.
Bancroft, orig. ed., iv. 43. On his plates, see
<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, ix. 248; <i>Mag. of Amer.
Hist.</i>, Jan., 1878, p. 52; and <i>Mag. of Western
History</i>, June, 1885, p. 207. A representation
of a broken plate found at the mouth of the
Muskingum River, in 1798, is given in S. P. Hildreth’s
<i>Pioneer Hist. of the Ohio Valley</i>, Cincinnati,
1848, p. 20, with the inscription on the one
found at the mouth of the Kenawha in 1846 (p.
23). An account of the Muskingum plate was
given by De Witt Clinton in the <i>Amer. Antiq.
Soc. Trans.</i>, ii. 430. Its defective inscription is
given in the <i>Mémoires sur les Affaires du Canada</i>,
p. 209. Cf. Sparks’s <i>Washington</i>, ii. 430.
Other fac-similes of these plates can be seen in
<i>Olden Time</i>, p. 288; <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vi. 611;

<p class="pfc4">The places where the plates were buried are
marked on a map preserved in the Marine at
Paris, made by Père Bonnecamps, who accompanied
Céloron. It shows eight points where
observations for latitude were taken, and extends
the Alleghany River up to Lake Chautauqua. It
is called <i>Carte d’un voyage, fait dans la belle
rivière en la Nouvelle France, 1749, par le reverend
Père Bonnecamps, Jesuite mathématicien</i>.
There is a copy in the Kohl Collection, in the
Department of State at Washington.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Kohl identifies the places of burial as follows:
Kananouangon (Warren, Pa.); Rivière aux
bœufs (Franklin, Pa.); R. Ranonouara (near
Wheeling); R. Yenariguékonnan (Marietta);
R. Chinodaichta (Pt. Pleasant, W. Va.); R. à la
Roche (mouth of Great Miami River).</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are two portages marked on the map:
one from Lake Chautauqua to Lake Erie, and the
other from La Demoiselle on the R. à la Roche
to Fort des Miamis on the R. des Miamis, flowing
into Lake Erie.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the annexed sketch of the map, the rude
marks of the fleur-de-lis show “les endroits ou
l’on enterré des lames de plomb;” the double
daggers “les latitudes observées;” and the
houses “les villages.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The map has been engraved in J. H. Newton’s
<i>Hist. of the Pan Handle, West Virginia</i>
(Wheeling, 1879), p. 37, with a large representation
of a plate found at the mouth of Wheeling
Creek (p. 40).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Spotswood in 1716 had taken similar measures
to mark the Valley of Virginia for the English
king. John Fontaine, who accompanied him,
says in his journal: “The governor had graving
irons, but could not grave anything, the stones
were so hard. The governor buried a bottle
with a paper enclosed, on which he writ that
he took possession of this place, and in the
name of and for King George the First of England.”

The home government ordered Virginia to
make this grant to the Ohio Company. In 1749,
800,000 acres were granted to the Loyal Company.
In 1751 the Green Briar Company received
100,000 acres. Up to 1757, Virginia had
granted 3,000,000 acres west of the mountains.</p>

<i>Sparks’s Catal.</i>, p. 224; also Sparks’s <i>Washington</i>,
i. 48, ii. p. x. Sparks considered that
these papers “filled up the chasm occasioned by
the loss of Washington’s papers” in the Braddock
campaign. Referring to Washington’s letters
during the French war, Sparks (ii., introd.)
says that Washington, twenty or thirty years
after they were written, caused them to be copied,
after he had revised them, and it is in this
amended condition they are preserved, though
several originals still exist. In his reply to Mahon
(Cambridge, 1852, p. 30) Sparks says that
this revision by Washington showed “numerous
erasures, interlineations, and corrections in
almost every letter,” probably meaning in those
whose originals are preserved. With the canons
governing Sparks as an editor, this revision
was followed in his edition of <i>Washington’s
Writings</i>; but the historian regrets, as he reads
the record in Sparks’s volumes, that the Washington
of the French war has partly disappeared
in the riper character which he became after he
had known the experiences of the American
Revolution.</p>

Brinley, ii. no. 4,189, a copy which brought
$560. Though described as in “the original
marble wrapper,” it did not have a map, as the
copy noted in the <i>Carter-Brown Catal.</i> (iii. 1,033)
does, though this may have been added from the
London reprint of the same year, which had “a
new map of the country as far as the Mississippi.”
This map is largely derived from Charlevoix.
Trumbull, in noting this reprint (Brinley, ii.
4,190), implies that the original edition did not
have a map, which may be inferred from what
Washington says of its being put hurriedly to
press, after he had had only a single day to write
it up from his rough notes. This London reprint
is also in the Carter-Brown library (iii. no.
1,034), and Thomson’s <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i> (no. 1,187)

Poole’s <i>Index</i> refers to the following:
“Washington and the death of Jumonville,” by
W. T. Anderson, in <i>Canadian Monthly</i>, i. p. 55;
“Washington and the Jumonville of M. Thomas,”
in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, vi. 201. The “Jumonville”
of Thomas was a poem published in
1759, reflecting severely on Washington, and
may be found in <i>Œuvres de Thomas, par M.
Saint-Surin</i>, v. p. 47. Peter Fontaine represents
the current opinion among the English, as to
Jumonville’s action, when he says that the
French “were in ambush in the woods waiting
for” Washington. (Maury’s <i>Huguenot Family</i>,
361.) It is not necessary to particularize the
references to Smollett, and Mahon, Marshall’s
<i>Washington</i>, Warburton’s <i>Conquest of Canada</i>,
and other obvious books; though something of
local help will be found in W. H. Lowdermilk’s
<i>History of Cumberland, Maryland, from 1728
up to the present day, embracing an account of
Washington’s first campaign, and battle of Fort
Necessity, with a history of Braddock’s expedition</i>,
etc., Washington, 1878. Sargent also goes over
the events in the introduction to his <i>Braddock’s
Expedition</i>, p. 43, etc., and epitomizes the account
by Adam Stephen in the <i>Pennsylvania
Gazette</i>, no. 1,343.</p>

A view of the fort is noted in the <i>Catal. of

of Fort Necessity and its surroundings,
from a survey made in 1816, is given in Lowdermilk’s
<i>Cumberland</i>, p. 76. A plan of the attack
is in Sparks’s <i>Washington</i>, i. 56. De Hass (<i>Western
Virginia</i>, 63, 65) says that in 1851 the embankments
of the fort could be traced; and that
at one time a proposition had been made to erect
a monument on the site.</p>

explain the causes of the rupture, which took
place at the outbreak of the French war, and
the text is supported by copious references
to treaties and documents.” Referring to a
copy with MS. notes by Gov. Hamilton, Parkman
says that the proprietary governor cavils
at several unimportant points, but suffers the
essential matter to pass unchallenged. Cf. <i>Several

Franklin, for the Autobiography of Franklin
(<i>Franklin’s Works</i>, ed. Sparks, i. 183,&mdash;some
errors pointed out, p. 192; Bigelow’s ed., p. 303)
gives some striking pictures of the confidence of
Braddock and the assurance of the public, the
indignation of Braddock towards what he conceived
to be the apathy if not disloyalty of the
Pennsylvanians, and the assistance of Franklin
himself in procuring wagons for the army (in
which he advanced money never wholly repaid,&mdash;<i>Franklin’s

point, see Sargent, p. 164; and <i>Penna. Archives</i>,

from Mr. Craig’s monthly publication, <i>The Olden
Time</i>, published in Pittsburgh in 1846-1848, and
reprinted in Cincinnati in 1876. It had a folded
map of Braddock’s route, repeated in the work
first named. Many of these <i>Olden Time</i> papers
are reprinted in the <i>Virginia Historical Register</i>,
v. 121.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The full title of Craig’s periodical was <i>The
Olden Time; a monthly publication devoted to the
preservation of documents and other authentic information

the settlement of the country around the head of the
Ohio</i>. (Cf. Thomson’s <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, nos. 280,

Periodical, devoted to the objects of the Logan Historical
Society; or to Collecting and Publishing
Sketches relative to the Early Settlement and Successive
Improvement of the Country. Edited and
Published by John S. Williams</i>. Vol. i., Chillicothe,
1842; vol. ii., Cincinnati, 1843. After the
removal of the place of publication to Cincinnati,
vol. i. was reprinted, which accounts for the
fact that in many copies vol. i. is dated Cincinnati,
1844, and vol. ii. 1843. The publication was
discontinued at the end of no. 10, vol. ii. It contains
journals of campaigns against the Indians,
narratives of captivity, incidents of border warfare,
biographical sketches, etc. The Logan
Historical Society was first organized on July
28, 1841, at Westfall, Pickaway County, near
the spot where Logan, the Mingo chief, is said
to have delivered his celebrated speech. The
society flourished for two or three years. Mr.
Williams was the secretary of the society. An
attempt was again made in 1849 to revive the
society, without success.</p>

Parkman notes (p. 221) as among his copies
a letter of Gov. Shirley to Robinson, Nov. 5,
1755, from the Public Record Office (<i>Amer. and
W. Indies</i>, lxxxii.); a report of the court of inquiry
into the behavior of the troops at the Monongahela;
Burd to Morris, July 25; Sinclair to
Robinson, Sept. 3, etc.</p>

The sermon was printed in Philad., and reprinted
in London in 1756. (Sabin, v. 18,763;
Hildeburn, i. no. 1,409; Brinley, i. 218.) There
are other symptoms of the time in another sermon
of the same preacher, Oct. 28, 1756. (Sabin,
v. 18,757.) Cf. Tyler, <i>Amer. Literature</i>, ii.
p. 242; and W. H. Foote’s <i>Sketches of Virginia</i>
(Phil., 1850), pp. 157, 284. See further on Davies
(who was later president of Princeton College)
and his relations to current events in
Sprague’s <i>Annals</i>, iii.; John H. Rice’s memoir
of him in the <i>Lit. and Evangelical Mag.</i>; Albert
Barnes’ “Life and Times of Davies,” prefixed
to <i>Davies’ Works</i> (N. Y., 1851); and David
Bostwick’s memoir of him accompanying Davies’
fulsome <i>Sermon on the Death of George II.</i>
(Boston, 1761).</p>

<i>America and West Indies</i>, lxxxii. Cf. the
statement of loss in <i>Collection de Manuscrits</i>
(Quebec), iii. 544, and in Sargent, p. 238. The
list of Braddock’s killed and wounded, as reported
in the <i>Gentleman’s Mag.</i>, Aug., 1755, is
reprinted in Lowdermilk’s <i>Cumberland</i>, p. 164.
There is among the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (no. xlviii.) a
paper, apparently contemporary, giving the British
loss, in which Washington is marked as
“wounded.”</p>

It is signed T. W., and is dated Boston,
Aug. 25, 1755. There were other editions the
same year at Bristol and London. Cf. Carter-Brown,

The book, which is very rare, was published
at Lexington, Ky., in 1799. (Field, <i>Ind. Bibliog.</i>,
no. 1,438; Thomson, <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, 1,055.) It
was reprinted in Cincinnati, in 1870 “with an
appendix of illustrative notes by W. M. Darlington,”
as no. 5 of the <i>Ohio Valley Historical
Series</i>. (Field, no. 1,440.) It was reprinted at
Philad. in 1831, since dated 1834. (Brinley, iii.
5,570.) The author published an abstract of it
in his <i>Treatise on the mode and manner of Indian
war</i>, Paris, Ky., 1812. (Field, no. 1,439.) Parkman
calls the earlier book “perhaps the best of
all the numerous narratives of captives among
the Indians.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is a sketch of Col. James Smith in J.
A. M’Clung’s <i>Sketches of Western Adventure</i>
(Dayton, Ohio, 1852). There have been other
reprints of the <i>Remarkable Occurrences</i> in Drake’s
<i>Tragedies of the Wilderness</i> (Boston, 1841); in
J. Pritt’s <i>Mirror of Olden Time Border Life</i>
(Abingdon, Va., 1849); in James Wimer’s <i>Events
in Indian History</i> (Lancaster, 1841); and in the
<i>Western Review</i>, 1821, vol. iv. (Lexington, Ky.).
These titles are noted at length in Thomson’s
<i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>.</p>

(Cf. Field, <i>Indian Bibliog.</i>, no. 1,394.) Shea
also edited in the Cramoisy series (100 copies),
as throwing some light on the battle and its hero
Beaujeu, <i>Registres des baptesmes et sepultures
qui se sont faits au Fort Du Quesne pendant les
années 1753, 1754, 1755, &amp; 1756</i>. <i>Nouvelle York</i>,
1859. (iv. 3-51 pp.) An English translation of
this by Rev. A. A. Lambing has been published
at Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Cf. the French account printed in the <i>Penna.
Archives</i>, 2d ser., vi. 256, and the statement of
the captured munitions (p. 262). Cf. <i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, x. 303, 311. Parkman (app. to vol. ii. 424)
brings forward the official report of Contrecœur
to Vaudreuil, July 14, 1755, and (p. 425) a letter
of Dumas, July 24, 1756, written to explain his
own services, both of which Parkman found in
the Archives of the Marine at Paris. It has
sometimes been held that Beaujeu, not Contrecœur,
commanded the post. (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, Sept.,
1859, iii. p. 274.) Parkman (i. p. 221) also notes
other papers among his own MSS. (copies) now
in the Mass. Hist. Soc. library. There is something
to be gleaned from the <i>Mass. Archives,
Doc. collected in France</i> (cf. vol. ix. 211), as well
as from the documents copied in Paris for the
State of New York (vol. xi., etc.).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Maurault, in his <i>Histoire des Abénakis</i> (1866),
gives a chapter to “les Abénakis à la bataille de
la Mononagahéla.” The part which Charles
Langlade, the partisan chief, took is set forth in
Tassé’s <i>Notice sur Charles Langlade</i> (in <i>Revue
Canadienne</i> originally), in Anburey’s <i>Travels</i>,
and in Draper’s “Recollections of Grignon”

Sargent, in picturing the condition of society
which thus existed, finds much help in Joseph
Doddridge’s <i>Notes of the Settlement and Indian
wars of the western parts of Virginia and Pennsylvania,
1763-1783, with a view of the state of
society and manners of the first settlers of the
western country</i>, Wellsburgh, Va., 1824. (Sargent,
<i>Braddock’s Exped.</i>, p. 80; Thomson, <i>Bibl.
of Ohio</i>, no. 331.) Doddridge was reprinted,
with some transpositions, in Kercheval’s <i>Hist. of
the Valley of Virginia</i> (Winchester, 1833, and
Woodstock, 1850,&mdash;Thomson, nos. 668-9); and
verbatim at Albany in 1876, edited by Alfred
Williams, and accompanied by a memoir of Doddridge
by his daughter (Thomson, no. 332).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Another monograph of interest in this study
is John A. M’Clung’s <i>Sketches of Western Adventure
... connected with the Settlement of the
West from 1755 to 1794</i>, Maysville, Ky., 1832.
Some copies have a Philadelphia imprint. There
were editions at Cincinnati in 1832, 1836, 1839,
1851, and at Dayton in 1844, 1847, 1852, 1854.
An amended edition, with additions by Henry
Waller, was printed at Covington, Ky., 1872.
(Thomson, <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, nos. 745-749.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of some value, also, is Wills De Hass’s <i>History
of the Early Settlement and Indian Wars of
Western Virginia, previous to 1795</i>, Wheeling,
1851. (Thomson, no. 318.)</p>

the correspondence of Washington (1756); in

ii.; Hazard’s <i>Penna. Reg.</i>; and in the French
documents quoted by Parkman, i. pp. 422-26.

Browne’s <i>Maryland</i>, 226.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is record of the provincial troops of
Pennsylvania employed in these years in the
<i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., vol. ii. In February,
1756, Governor Morris wrote to Shirley, describing
the defences he had been erecting along
the borders. (<i>Penna. Archives</i>, ii. 569.) There
is in <i>Ibid.</i>, xii. p. 323, a list of forts erected in
Pennsylvania during this period. The enumeration
shows one built in 1747, one in 1749, two
in 1753, seven in 1754, eleven in 1755, twenty-one
in 1756, three in 1757, three in 1758, and one in
1759. Plans are given of Forts Augusta at Shamokin,
Bedford at Raystown, Ligonier at Loyalhannon,
and Pitt at Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In 1756, William Smith (<i>Hist. New York</i>, 1814,
p. 243) says that William Johnson, within nine
months after the arrival of Braddock, received
£10,000 to use in securing the alliance and pacification
of the Indians.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There was published in London in 1756 an
<i>Account of conferences and treaties between Sir
William Johnson and the chief Sachems, etc., on
different occasions at Fort Johnson, in 1755 and
1756</i> (Brinley, iii. no. 5,495), and in New York

The book was first published in London in
1759. (Carter-Brown, iii. 1,217.) Sparks, in reprinting
it in his edition of <i>Franklin’s Works</i>, ii.
p. 107, examines the question of Franklin’s relations
to its composition and publication. The
book had an appendix of original papers respecting
the controversy. The copy which belonged
to Thomas Penn is in the Franklin Collection,
now in Washington. (<i>U. S. Doc.</i>, no.
60.) Cf. <i>Catal. of Franklin Books in Boston

Dr. Franklin and the Rev. William Smith
are said to have had a hand in <i>A Brief State of
the Province of Pennsylvania, in which the conduct
of their assemblies for several years past is
impartially examined</i>, London, 1755. (Rich,
<i>Bibl. Americana Nova</i> (after 1700), p. 111;
Thomson, <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, 1,070; Carter-Brown,
iii. nos. 1,082, 1,133; Brinley, ii. no. 3,034;
Cooke, no. 2,007; a third edition bears date
1756. It was reprinted by Sabin in N. Y. in
1865.) The purpose of this tract was (in the
opinion of the Quakers) to make them obnoxious
to the British government by showing their factious
spirit of opposition to measures calculated
to advance the interests of the province; and on
the other side, <i>An Answer to an invidious pamphlet
entitled A Brief State</i>, etc., said to be by
one Cross, was published the same year in London.
(Carter-Brown, iii. no. 1,083; Cooke, no.
2,008; Brinley, ii. 3,035; Rich, <i>Bib. Am. Nov.</i>
(after 1700), p. 111.) A sequel to the <i>Brief
State</i>, etc., appeared in London in 1756 as <i>A
Brief View of the Conduct of Pennsylvania for
the year 1755, so far as it affected the service of
the British Colonies, particularly the Expedition
under the late General Braddock</i> (Carter-Brown,
iii. no. 1,132; Thomson, <i>Bibl. of Ohio</i>, no. 1,072;
Cooke, no. 2,006; Brinley, ii. 3,036; Menzies,
1,580-82; Field, <i>Ind. Bibliog.</i>, 1,446; Barlow’s
<i>Rough List</i>, no. 937), which included an account
of the contemporary incursions of the Indians
along the Pennsylvania frontiers. A French
version was printed in Paris the same year, under
the title of <i>Etat présent de la Pensilvanie</i>
(Brinley, i. 225; Murphy, 329; Quaritch, 1885,
no. 29,677, £2 10<i>s.</i>). The Barlow <i>Rough List</i>,
no. 930, assigns it to the Abbé Delaville. It had
“une carte particulière de cette colonie.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Quakers found a defender in <i>An humble
apology for the Quakers, occasioned by certain
gross abuses and imperfect vindications of that people,
... to which are added Observations on A
Brief View, and a much fairer method pointed
out than that contained in The Brief State, to prevent
the encroachments of the French</i>, London,
1756. (Brinley, ii. 3,041.) The latest contribution
to this controversy was <i>A True and Impartial
State of the Province of Pennsylvania</i>, Philadelphia,
1759. (Carter-Brown, iii. no. 1,232;
Brinley, ii. 3,040; Cooke, no. 2,009.) Hildeburn
(<i>Century of Printing</i>, i. no. 1,649) says it
was thought to be by Franklin. Parkman (i.
p. 351) calls this “an able presentation of the
case of the assembly, omitting, however, essential
facts.” This historian adds: “Articles on
the quarrel will also be found in the provincial
newspapers, especially the <i>New York Mercury</i>,
and in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for 1755 and
1756. But it is impossible to get any clear and
just view of it without wading through the interminable
documents concerning it in the <i>Colonial
Records of Pennsylvania</i> and the <i>Pennsylvania
Archives</i>.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Parkman also traces the rise of the disturbance
in his <i>Pontiac</i>, i. p. 83; and refers further
to Proud’s <i>Pennsylvania</i>, app., and Hazard’s
<i>Penna. Reg.</i>, viii. 273, 293, 323.</p>

Cf. Parton’s <i>Franklin</i>, i. 357; and Franklin’s

drafted the militia act of Pennsylvania, which
was passed Nov. 25, 1755. (<i>Gentleman’s Mag.</i>,
1756, vol. xxvi.) In Nov., 1755, Gov. Belcher

Samuel Blodget’s <i>Prospective plan of the battle
near Lake George, on the eighth day of September,
1755, with an explanation thereof; containing
a full, tho’ short History of that important
affair</i>, was engraved by Thomas Johnston, and
published in Boston by Richard Draper, 1755.
(Brinley, i. 209.) The size of the plate is 14×18
inches, and the text is called <i>Account of the
engagement near Lake George, with a whole sheet
plan of the encampment and view of the battle between
the English and the French and Indians</i>
(4to, pp. 5). It is dedicated to Gov. Shirley. A
copy belonging to W. H. Whitmore is at present
in the gallery of the Bostonian Society, Old
State House, Boston. It was reëngraved (“not
very accurately,” says Trumbull) by Jefferys in
London, and was published Feb. 2, 1756, accompanied
by <i>An Explanation ... by Samuel Blodget,
occasionally at the Camp, when the battle was
fought</i>. (Sabin, ii. 5,955; Harv. Coll. library,
5325.45.) Jefferys inserted the plate also in his
<i>General Topog. of North America and the West
Indies</i>, London, 1768. It was from Jefferys’ reproduction
that it was repeated in Bancroft’s
<i>United States</i> (orig. ed., iv. 210); in Gay’s <i>Pop.
Hist. United States</i>, iii. p. 288; in <i>Doc. Hist. New
York</i>, iv. 169; and in Dr. Hough’s ed. of <i>Pouchot</i>.
The plate shows two engagements, with a side
chart of the Hudson from New York upwards:
<i>first</i>, the ambuscade in which Williams and
Hendrick were killed; and <i>second</i>, the attack of
Dieskau on the hastily formed breastwork at the
lake. The plate, as engraved by Jefferys, is entitled
<i>A prospective View of the Battle fought near
Lake George on the 8th of Sep<sup>r</sup>, 1755, between 2,000
English and 250 Mohawks under the Command of
Gen<sup>l</sup> Johnson, and 2,500 French and Indians
under the Command of Genl Dieskau, in which
the English were victorious, captivating the French
General, with a number of his men, killing 700
and putting the rest to flight</i>.</p>

so striking as to warrant the conclusion that
Smith must have had a share in the <i>Review</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Sedgwick (<i>Wm. Livingston</i>, p. 114) says: “Allowance
is to be made for its bitter attacks upon
the character of De Lancey, Pownall, and Johnson.”
William Smith, alleged to have been a
party to its production, says: “No reply was ever
made to it; it was universally read and talked of
in London, and worked consequences of private
and public utility. General Shirley emerged
from a load of obloquy.” De Lancey (Jones’
<i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>, i. 436) holds that, while
Livingston was doubtless cognizant of its publication,
its real author was probably William
Smith.</p>

The histories have usually stated that Dieskau
was mortally wounded, and Bancroft (<i>United

of him as “incurably wounded,” has changed it
in his final revision (vol. ii. 435) to “mortally
wounded,”&mdash;hardly true in the usual acceptation
of the word, since Dieskau lived for a dozen
years, though his wounds were indeed the ultimate
cause of his death.</p>

Cf. L. C. Draper’s “Expedition against the
Shawanoes,” in the <i>Virginia Historical Register</i>
(vol. v. 61). Later in the season the Pennsylvanians
(July and Nov., 1756) sought to quiet the
tribes by conferences at Easton. Cf. <i>Penna.
Archives</i>, ii. 722, etc., and Sparks’ note in <i>Franklin’s
Works</i>, vii. 125, and the histories of Pennsylvania,
and <i>Several Conferences of the Quakers
and the deputies from the Six Indian Nations, in
order to reclaim the Delaware Indians</i>, Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
1756, noted in Carter-Brown, iii.
no. 1,118. Hildeburn, i. nos. 1,538, 1,539, 1,540,
and the <i>Catal. of works relating to Franklin in
the Boston Public Library</i>, p. 35, give these various
publications. The opposition of the Quakers
to the war was still an occasion of attacks
upon them. Cf. <i>A true relation of a bloody battle
fought between George and Lewis</i> (Philad., 1756),
noted in Hildeburn, i. no. 1,476. In Jan., the
New Jersey government had made a treaty at
Croswicks, and the proceedings of the conference
were printed at Philad. (Cf. Hildeburn,
i. no. 1,504; Haven, in Thomas, ii. p. 530.) Governor
Sharp erected Fort Frederick for the defence
of the Maryland frontier. Its ruins are
shown in Scharf’s <i>Maryland</i>, i. 491.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the accounts of “captivities” which
grew out of the frontier warfare of Pennsylvania,
the <i>Narrative of the sufferings and surprising deliverance
of William and Elizabeth Fleming</i> was
one of the most popular. It was printed in Philadelphia,
Lancaster (Pa.), and Boston, in 1756, in
English, and at Lancaster in German. (Hildeburn,
nos. 1,465-1,468.) The <i>Captivity of Hugh
Gibson</i> among the Delawares, 1756-59, is printed
in the <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, xxv. 141. A <i>Journal of
the Captivity of Jean Lowry and her children,
giving an account of her being taken by the Indians,
April 1, 1756, in the Rocky Spring settlement
in Pennsylvania</i>, was printed in Philadelphia
in 1760. (Hildeburn, <i>Century of Printing</i>,
i. no. 1,683.) On the Indian depredations at
Juniata in 1756, see Egle’s <i>Hist. Register</i>, iii. 54.</p>

In the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vii., these conferences
of 1756 can be followed equally well, beginning
with a long paper by the secretary of
Indian affairs, Peter Wraxall, in which he examines
the causes of the declension of British interests
with the Six Nations (p. 15), with records
of conferences from March through the season

The Journals give a sketch of the intrenchment
near Fort William Henry, laid out by
James Montresor (p. 23), and describe how the
firing was heard at Fort Edward (p. 26), and how
the survivors of the massacre came in (p. 28).
Webb’s reports to the governor during this period
are noted in Goldsbrow Banyar’s diary
(Aug. 5-20), in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, January,
1877. The <i>Journal of General Rufus Putnam,
kept in Northern New York during four campaigns,

Stone’s <i>Johnson</i>, ii. 47. The admirer of
Cooper will remember the interest with which
he read the story of Fort William Henry as engrafted
upon <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, but the
novelist’s rendering of the massacre is sharply
criticised by Martin in his <i>De Montcalm en Canada</i>,
chaps. 4 and 5. Cf. also Rameau, <i>La France
aux Colonies</i>, ii. p. 306. Cooper, in fact, embodied
the views which at once became current, that
the French did nothing to prevent the massacre.
The news of the fall of the fort reached the eastern
colonies by way of Albany, where the fright
was excessive, and it was coupled with the assurance
that the massacre had been connived at
by the French. (<i>N. H. Prov. Papers</i>, vi. 604,
605.) Montcalm had apprehensions that he
would be reproached, and that the massacre
might afford ground to the English for breaking
the terms of the surrender. He wrote at once
to Webb and to Loudon, and charged the furor
of the Indians upon the English rum (<i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, x. 618, 619), and Vaudreuil wrote a letter
(p. 631) of palliation. Some later writers, like
Grahame (<i>United States</i>, iv. 7), do not acquit
Montcalm; but the more considerate hardly go
further than to question his prudence in not providing
a larger escort. (Warburton, <i>Conquest of
Canada</i>, ii. 67.) Potter (<i>Adj.-Gen. Rep. of N. H.</i>,
1866, ii. 190) says that of 200 men of that province,
bringing up the rear of the line of retreating
English, 80 were killed; and he reminds the
apologists of Montcalm that, when the English
were advised to defend themselves, the French
general knew that they had not surrendered till
their ammunition was expended. Stone (<i>Johnson</i>,
ii. 49) says that thirty were killed. Parkman
(i. p. 512) says it is impossible to tell with
exactness how many were killed&mdash;about fifty, according
to French accounts, not including those
murdered in the hospitals. Of the six or seven
hundred carried off by the Indians, a large part
were redeemed by the French. The evidence,
which is rather confusing, is examined also in
Watson’s <i>County of Essex, N. Y.</i>, p. 74. Cf. <i>Les
Ursulines de Québec</i>, 1863, vol. ii. p. 295.</p>

Of the later writers, see Parkman, ii. 6;
Stone’s <i>Johnson</i>, ii. 54; Simms’s <i>Frontiersmen
of N. Y.</i>, 231; and Nath. S. Benton’s <i>Herkimer
County</i>, which rehearses the history of the Palatine
community, 1709-1783. Parkman, referring
to Loudon’s despatches as he found them in the
Public Record Office, says they were often tediously
long. They were, it seems, in keeping
with the provoking dilatoriness in coming to
a point which characterized all his lordship’s
movements. Franklin gives some amusing instances.
(Cf. Parton’s <i>Franklin</i>, i. p. 383;
Sparks’ <i>Franklin</i>, i. 217-21.) “The miscarriages
in all our enterprises,” wrote Peter Fontaine in
1757, “have rendered us a reproach, and to the
last degree contemptible in the eyes of our savage
Indian and much more inhuman French enemies.”

however, that these mounds are relics of the

Parkman refers (ii. 432) to letters of Colonel
Woolsey and others in the <i>Bouquet and Haldimand
Papers</i> in the British Museum. A letter
of Sir William Grant is given in Maclachlan’s
<i>Highlands</i> (1875), ii. 340. Knox (i. 148) gives a
letter from an officer. Dwight refers to a letter
in the <i>New Amer. Magazine</i>. There are among
the letters of Chas. Lee to his sister (<i>N. Y. Hist.
Coll.</i>, 1871) one from Schenectady, June 18, and
one from Albany, Sept. 16, 1758. He describes
his being wounded at Ticonderoga, and is very
severe on the “Booby-in-chief.” Other letters
are in the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, 1758. The <i>Boston Evening
Post</i>, July 24, 1758, has “the latest advices
from Lake George, published by authority,” in
which, speaking of Montcalm’s lines, it is said
that “the ease with which they might be forced
proved a mistake; for it was not possible with
the utmost exaction of bravery to carry them.”
It gives a table of losses as then reported; and
adds extracts from a letter dated Saratoga, July
12, “which are not authenticated.” There is in
the <i>Israel Williams MSS.</i>, in the Mass. Hist. Soc.
library, a letter from Col William Williams,
dated July 11, 1758, at Lake George, as at “a
sorrowful situation.” The same papers contain
also a letter from Oliver Partridge, Lake George,
July 12, 1758; a detailed account of the campaign,
by Col. Israel Williams; a letter of his nephew,
Col. William Williams, Aug. 21, 1758; a rough

Israel Williams, dated at Hatfield, Aug. 7, 1758;

<p class="pfc4">M. Daine, in a letter to Marshal de Belle Isle,

of the victory at Carillon, as he had collected
them from the letters of different officers
who were in the action. (<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x.

The first attempt to recount the exploits of
Wolfe in the shape of a regular biography was
made by a weak and florid writer, who, in 1760,
“according to the rules of eloquence,” as he professed,
got out a brief <i>Life of General James
Wolfe</i>, which was in the same year reprinted
in Boston. (Carter-Brown, iii. 1,280; Haven in
Thomas, p. 557.) Nothing adequate was done,
however, for a long time after, and the reader
had to gather what he could from the <i>Annual
Register</i>, Smollett’s <i>England</i>, Walpole’s <i>George
II.</i>, or from the contemporary histories of Entick
and Mante. (Cf. various expressions in Walpole’s
<i>Letters</i>.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">The letters of Wolfe to his parents were not
used till Thomas Streatfeild made an abstract of
a part of them for a proposed history of Kent;
but his project falling through, the papers passed
by Mahon’s influence (<i>Hist. of England</i>, 3d ed.,
iv. 151) to the Rev. G. R. Gleig, who used them
in his <i>Lives of the Most Eminent British Military
Commanders</i> (1832). About 1827, such of the
Wolfe papers as had descended from General
Warde, the executor of Wolfe’s mother, to his
nephew, Admiral George Warde, were placed in
Robert Southey’s hands, but a life of Wolfe
which he had designed was not prepared, and
the papers were lost sight of until they appeared
as lots 531, 532 of the <i>Catalogue of the Dawson
Turner Sale</i> in 1858, which also contained an independent
collection of “Wolfiana.” Upon due
presentation of the facts, the lots above named
were restored to the Warde family, together
with the “Wolfiana,” as it was not deemed desirable
to separate the two collections. This
enlarged accumulation was submitted to Mr.
Robert Wright, who produced the <i>Life of Major-General
James Wolfe</i>, which was published in
London in 1864. To the domestic correspondence
of Wolfe above referred to, which ceases
to be full when the period of his greatest fame is
reached, Mr. Wright added other more purely
military papers, which opportunely came in his
way. Some of these had belonged to Col. Rickson,
a friend of Wolfe, and being filed in an
old chest, in whose rusty lock the key had been
broken, they had remained undisturbed till about
forty years ago, when the chest was broken open,
and the papers were used by Mr. John Buchanan
in a sketch of Wolfe, which he printed in <i>Tait’s
Magazine</i> in 1849, and reprinted in his <i>Glasgow
Past and Present</i> in 1856. Wright found the
originals in the Museum of the Antiquarian Society
of Scotland, at Edinburgh, and he says
they, better than the letters addressed to his
mother, exhibit the tone and bent of Wolfe’s
mind. The letters which passed between Wolfe
and Amherst during the siege of Louisbourg
(1758) were submitted to Wright by Earl Amherst,
and from these, from the “Wolfiana” of
Dawson Turner, from the <i>Chatham</i> and <i>Bedford
Correspondence</i>, he gathered much unused material
to illustrate the campaigns which closed
the struggle for Canada. See particularly a letter
of Wolfe, from Halifax, May 1, 1759, detailing
the progress of preparations, which is in the
<i>Chatham Correspondence</i>, i. 403, as is one of Sept.
9, dated on board the “Sutherland,” off Cape
Rouge (p. 425). Walpole speaks of the last letter
received from Wolfe before news came of his
success, and of that letter’s desponding character.
“In the most artful terms that could be framed,
he left the nation uncertain whether he meant to
prepare an excuse for desisting, or to claim the
melancholy merit of having sacrificed himself
without a prospect of success.” (<i>Mem. of the
Reign of George II.</i>, 2d ed., iii. p. 218.) Mr.
Wright, from a residence in Canada, became
familiar with the scenes of Wolfe’s later life, and
was incited thereby to the task which he has
very creditably performed.</p>

<p class="pfc4 p1">On the French side we have:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">1. <i>The Second Report of the Hist. MSS. Commission</i>
(p. 30) notes, as among the Earl of Cathcart
papers, a folio MS., “Journal de la expédition

extends from May 1 to May 10, according to the
report.</p>
<p class="pfc4">2. Martin, in his <i>De Montcalm en Canada</i>, p.
239, describes an English MS. in the Bibliothèque
du Ministère de la Guerre (Paris), called for a
general title <i>Memoirs of a French Officer</i>, and
divided into two parts:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">(1.) Begins with a narrative of the Scottish rebellion
in 1745, and then gives “An account of
the war in Canada to the capitulation of Montreal
in 1760, with an account of the siege of
Louisbourg in 1758, and an exact and impartial
account of the hostilities committed in Acadia
and Cape Breton before the declaration of war.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">(2.) <i>a.</i> Dialogue in Hades between Montcalm
and Wolfe, reviewing, in the spirit of a military
critic, the mistakes of both generals in the conduct
of the campaign, not only of Quebec, but
of the other converging forces of the English.
This portion is given in English in the <i>Hist.
Docs. of the Lit. and Hist. Soc. of Quebec</i>. Martin
has a French translation of it.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>b.</i> “A critical, impartial, and military history
of the war in Canada until the capitulation signed
in 1760.” Published by the Lit. and Hist. Soc.
of Quebec in 1867.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The whole MS. is attributed to a Scotch Jacobite,
Chevalier Johnston, who after the suppression
of the Scotch revolt went to France, and
served in the campaign of this year in Canada as
aid to Lévis, and afterwards as aid to Montcalm.</p>
<p class="pfc4">3. In the first series (1840) of the <i>Hist. Docs.
of the Lit. and Hist. Soc. of Quebec</i> there is a
“Relation de ce qui s’est passé au siége de Québec,
et de la prise du Canada, par une Religieuse
de l’Hôpital Général de Québec: addressée à
une communauté de son ordre en France.” It
is thought to have been written in 1765; and the
original belongs to the Séminaire de Québec. It
was again printed at Quebec in 1855.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There was also published at Quebec, about
1827, an English version, <i>The siege of Quebec, and
conquest of Canada: in 1759</i>. <i>By a nun of the
general hospital of Quebec. Appended an account
of the laying of the first stone of the monument to
Wolfe and Montcalm.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">4. Parkman (ii. 438) considers one of the most
important unpublished documents to be the narrative
of M. de Foligny, a naval officer commanding
one of the batteries in the town, namely
a <i>Journal mémoratif de ce qui s’est passé de plus
remarquable pendant qu’a duré le siége de la ville
de Québec</i>. It is preserved in the Archives de la
Marine at Paris.</p>
<p class="pfc4">5. In the <i>Hist. Docs. of the Lit. and Hist. Soc.
of Quebec</i>, 4th series, there is a paper, “Siége de
Québec en 1759&mdash;journal tenu par M. Jean
Claude Panet, ancien notaire de Québec.” It is
the work of an eye-witness, and begins May 10.</p>
<p class="pfc4">6. “Journal tenu à l’armée que commandait
feu M. le Marquis de Montcalm” is also printed
in the <i>Hist. Docs. of the Lit. and Hist. Soc. of
Quebec</i>. Parkman calls it minute and valuable.</p>
<p class="pfc4">7. Parkman cites, as from the Archives de la
Marine, <i>Mémoires sur la Campagne de 1759, par
M. de Joannès, major de Québec</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">8. <i>Siégede Québec, en 1759. Copie d’après un
manuscrit apporté de Londres, par l’honorable D.
B. Viger, lors de son retour en Canada, en septembre
1834-mai 1835. Copie d’un manuscrit déposé
à la bibliothèque de Hartwell en Angleterre.</i> This
was printed in a small edition at Quebec in 1836,
and Parkman (ii. 438) calls it a very valuable
diary of a citizen of Quebec.</p>
<p class="pfc4">9. In the first series of the <i>Hist. Docs. of the
Lit. and Hist. Soc. of Quebec</i> is a “Jugement impartial
sur les opérations militaires de la campagne
en 1759, par M<sup>gr</sup> de Pontbriand, Évêque
de Québec.” It aims only to touch controverted
points. It is translated in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x.
1059. Cf. “Lettres de M<sup>gr</sup> Pontbriand,” in <i>Revue
Canadienne</i>, viii. 438.</p>
<p class="pfc4">10. Leclerc, in his <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i> (Maisonneuve,
Paris), 1878, no. 770, describes a manuscript,
<i>Mémoires sur les affaires du Canada,
1756-1760, par Potot de Montbeillard, Commandant
d’Artillerie</i>, as a daily journal, written on the
spot, never printed, and one of three copies
known. Priced at 400 francs. This has been
secured by Mr. Parkman since the publication
of his book.</p>
<p class="pfc4">11. The Lit. and Hist. Soc. of Quebec has
also printed a document, the original of which
was found in the Archives du département de la
Guerre at Paris, entitled: <i>Événements de la
Guerre en Canada durant les années 1759 et 1760:
Relation du Siége de Québec du 27 Mai au 8 Aôut,
1759: Campagne du Canada depuis le 1<sup>er</sup> Juin jusqu’au
15 Septembre, 1759</i>. These are followed
by other documents, including no. 6 (<i>ante</i>).</p>

These are translated in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x.,
with others: such as a published narrative of the
French, ending Aug. 8 (p. 993); an account,
June 1 to Sept. 15 (p. 1001); Montreuil’s letter
(p. 1013); a journal of operations with Montcalm’s
army (p. 1016); and Bigot’s letter to Belle
Isle on the closing movements of the siege (p.
1051).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The collection of Montcalm letters in the
Parkman MSS., copied from the originals in the
possession of the present Marquis of Montcalm,
begins in America, May 19 (Quebec), 1756,
when he says that he had arrived on the 12th.
The others are from Montreal, June 16, 19, July
20, Aug. 30; from Carillon, Sept. 18; from Montreal,
Nov. 3, 9, Apr. 1 (1757), 16, 24, June 6,

Sept. 25, Oct. 16, 27; from Montreal, Nov. 21,
29, Apr. 12 (1759), May 16, 19.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Parkman MSS. also contain letters of
Montcalm to Bourlamaque, copied from the
Bourlamaque papers, beginning with one from
Montreal, June 25, 1756, and they are continued
to his death; to which are added letters of Bougainville
and Bernetz, written after the death of
Montcalm.</p>

In this last there seems to be an allusion to
a book which appeared in London in 1777, in
French and English, published by Almon, called
<i>Lettres de Monsieur le Marquis de Montcalm à
Messieurs de Berryer et de la Molé, écrites dans
les années 1757, 1758, et 1759</i>. (Sabin, xii. p. 305;
Barlow’s <i>Rough List</i>, no. 1,095.) The letters
were early suspected to be forgeries, intended to
help the argument of the American cause in
1777 by prognosticating the resistance and independency
of the English colonists, to follow upon
the conquest of Canada and the enforced taxation
of the colonies by the crown. These views
came out in what purported to be a letter from
Boston, signed “S. J.,” to Montcalm, and by him
cited and accepted. The alleged letters were
apparently passed round in manuscript in London
as early as Dec., 1775, when Hutchinson
(<i>Diary and Letters</i>, p. 575) records that Lord
Hardwicke sent them to him, “which I doubt
not,” adds the diarist, “are fictitious, as they
agree in no circumstance with the true state of
the colonies at the time.” Despite the doubt
attaching to them, they have been quoted by
many writers as indicating the prescience of
Montcalm; and the essential letter to Molé is
printed, for instance, without qualification by
Warburton in his <i>Conquest of Canada</i> (vol. ii.),
and is used by Bury in his <i>Exodus of the Western
Nations</i>, by Barry in his <i>Hist. of Mass.</i>, by Miles
in his <i>Canada</i> (p. 425), and by various others.
Lord Mahon gave credence to it in his <i>Hist.
of England</i> (orig. ed., vi. 143; but see 5th ed.,
vi. 95). Carlyle came across this letter in a
pamphlet by Lieut.-Col. Beatson, <i>The Plains
of Abraham</i>, published at Gibraltar in 1858,
and citing it thence embodied it in his <i>Frederick
the Great</i>. Ten years later Parkman found
a copy of the letter among the papers of the
present Marquis de Montcalm, but inquiry established
the fact that it was not in the autograph
of the alleged writer. This, with certain
internal evidences, constitutes the present
grounds for rejecting the letters as spurious, and
Parkman further points out (vol. ii. 326) that
Verreau identifies the handwriting of the suspected
copy of the letter as that of Roubaud.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Mr. Parkman first made a communication respecting
the matter to the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
June, 1869 (vol. xi. pp. 112-128), where the editor,
Dr. Charles Deane, appended notes on the
vicissitudes of the opinions upon the genuineness
of the letters; and these data were added
to by Henry Stevens in a long note in his
<i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, no. 1,336. Carlyle finally
accepted the arguments against them. (<i>M. H.
Soc. Proc.</i>, Jan., 1870, vol. xi. 199.)</p>

This periodical was begun in 1758, and Mahon
speaks of its narratives as “written with
great spirit and compiled with great care.”</p>

The victory of Quebec, as well as British
successes in Germany, induced the formation in
England of a “Society for the Encouragement
of the British Troops,” of which Jonas Hanway
printed at London, in 1760, an <i>Account</i>, detailing
the assistance which had been rendered to soldiers’
widows, etc. (Sabin, viii. no. 30,276. There

<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, x. 1139. There are letters
received by Bourlamaque between June 28, 1756,
and the end of the contest in Canada (1760), preserved
in the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps.
They are from Vaudreuil, De Lévis (after
1759), Berniers, Bougainville, Murray, Malartic,
D’Hébécourt, etc. Copies of them are in the
Parkman MSS. (Mass. Hist. Soc.).</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is a summary of the strategical movements
of the war in a <i>Précis of the Wars in Canada,
1755-1814</i>, prepared, by order of the Duke
of Wellington in 1826, by Maj.-Gen. Sir James
Carmichael-Smyth, “for the use and convenience
of official people only.” During the American
civil war (1862) a public edition was issued, edited
by the younger Sir James Carmichael, with
the thought that some entanglement of Great
Britain in the American civil war (1861-1865)
might render the teachings of the book convenient.
The editor, in an introduction, undertakes
to say “that the State of Maine has exhibited
an unmistakable desire for annexation to the
British Crown,” which, if carried out, would
enable Great Britain better to maintain military
connection between Canada and New Brunswick.</p>

Mante’s account is copied in Hough’s <i>St.

the passage down the St. Lawrence is treated at
length. Dr. Hough judges the account of the
taking of Fort Lévis, as given by David Humphrey
in his <i>Works</i> (New York, 1804, p. 280), to
be mostly fabulous. Hough (p. 704) also prints
Governor Colden’s proclamation on the capture.
Pouchot gives a plan of the attack. There

The success of the campaign made Amherst
a Knight of the Bath, and his investiture with
the insignia took place at Staten Island in Oct.,
1761, and is described in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>,
ii. 502.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Charles Carroll (<i>Journal to Canada</i>, ed. 1876,
p. 86) seems to give it as a belief current in his
time (1776) that Amherst took the route by Oswego
and the St. Lawrence because he feared
being foiled by obstructions at Isle-aux-Noix.
The correspondence of Amherst and the Nova
Scotia authorities is noted in T. B. Akins’s <i>List
of MS. Docs. in the government offices at Halifax</i>
(1886), p. 12.</p>

misfortune that there is no mutual dependence, no close connection between these several colonies: they are
quite disunited by separate views and distinct interests, and like a bold and rapid river, which, though resistless
when included in one channel, is yet easily resistible when subdivided into several inferior streams.”

<p class="pfc4">Burke was held to be the author of a tract, <i>Comparative importance of the commercial principles of the
late negotiation between Great Britain and France in 1761, in which the system of that negotiation with
regard to our colonies and commerce is considered</i>, London, 1762. (Carter-Brown, iii. no. 1,319.)</p>

Carter-Brown, iii. 1,263-1,266. The two great men were Pitt and Newcastle. The <i>Letter</i> was reprinted in
Boston, 1760. As to its authorship, Halkett and Laing say that it “was generally attributed to William Pulteney,
Earl of Bath, and is so attributed in Lord Stanhope’s <i>History of England</i>; but according to Chalmers’
<i>Biographical Dictionary</i> it was really written by John Douglas, D. D., Bishop of Salisbury.” Sabin says that
it has been attributed to Junius. Cf. Bancroft, orig. ed., iv. p. 364.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
